The weather was a bit ropey on Tuesday morning, so I thought I’d go into [Fernandez and Wells](http://www.fernandezandwells.com/beak.php) coffee shop on Beak Street on my way to work.
I’d not been in before even though it’s only about 50 yards away from our office on Great Pulteney Street. I’d heard good things about it, although it always looked a bit pricey.

It turns out both of those things were correct - I think my espresso was truly the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had, but along with a freshly squeezed orange juice it officially cost a “bloody fortune”. Very nice for the occasional treat, but I don’t think I could afford to go in every day.
