Already a bit bored by the dull lunch options around Victoria, so we took a walk over to Pimlico to go to Pimlico Fresh, a nice little cafe about 10 minutes walk from the office.
Now I’d been there before when I used to that way last year, but with my quiche I had something new - pea salad with feta and a little spinach. It was quite nice and it was only later I realised what I’d really had was posh cheezy peas :-)
