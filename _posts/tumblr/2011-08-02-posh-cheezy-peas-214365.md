Already a bit bored by the dull lunch options around Victoria, so we took a walk over to Pimlico to go to [Pimlico Fresh](http://www.bing.com/local/details.aspx?lid=YN1098x233004030&q=Pimlico%20Fresh%20Pimlico%2c%20London&qt=yp&tid=8e143f2e49ab4b748ad1d74a1bf667aa&mkt=en-gb&FORM=LLSV), a nice little cafe about 10 minutes walk from the office.

Now I’d been there before when I used to that way last year, but with my quiche I had something new - pea salad with feta and a little spinach. It was quite nice and it was only later I realised what I’d really had was posh cheezy peas :-)
