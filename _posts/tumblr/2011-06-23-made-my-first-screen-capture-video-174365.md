I wanted to do a good demo for the Hack Day project, but didn’t trust my connection into work from home to be reliable enough to show my app in it’s full glory. So I had the idea of recording a screen capture video beforehand, and then I could share and show that instead.
The only trouble was I had no idea how I could do that. However after a bit of research and some help from Ross we figured out I could use the free version of Microsoft Expression which has screen capture software built in. Perfect.
I think the video turned out reasonably well although it was a bit rushed. It would take a lot of practice to get good at making them, but I think my “first take” approach is as good as I can do without making an effort :-)
