We were trying to arrange a mini-Xmas lunch at work for a few of us, but Mark couldn’t make it so he very generously offered to take us out for Xmas breakfast/brunch instead.

He’d booked us into the [The Goring Hotel](http://www.thegoring.com/), a very posh place where Princess Kate (or whatever she calls herself now) stayed the night before the royal wedding.

The food was OK (meat eaters breakfast looked more substantial), and the service was slightly weird as I don’t think they were really expecting 4 nerds from Microsoft to turn up - not their typical clientèle I expect.

All in all it was a very interesting experience, definitely something new, and many thanks to Mark for taking us there.
