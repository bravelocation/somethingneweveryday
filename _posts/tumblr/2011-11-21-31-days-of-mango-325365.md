Found a great website on Monday called [31 Days Of Mango](http://www.jeffblankenburg.com/2011/10/31/31-days-of-mango/), which as you’d expect from the name has one tip each day for a month on developing for Windows Phone 7.

There were lots of new things I learnt from the site (and continue to do so), and in particular it made me understand a bug I have in my Bedside Clock application in how it didn’t handle the change of power state very well. Turns out - which I should have realised - I need to make sure the UI updating code needs to be on a different thread.

If you’re doing any WP7 phone development, I definitely recommend taking a look at the site.
