Because I’m travelling up and down the country every week for work, we need to be a bit more organised about arranging my summer holidays than our usual leave-it-to-the-last minute way of doing it.
We had a great - if expensive - time in Norway a couple of years ago, so we’d decided to go back to Scandanavia this summer. We’re going to spend 4 days in Stockholm, then 4 days in Copenhagen, getting the train between the two.
I managed to save a bit using my large pile of BA air miles, and got a reasonable deals on what look like some really nice hotels in both cities so we’re really looking forward to our trip towards the end of July.
