On the way back from Reading the timing was really bad. It was a sweltering day in London, and with Spurs playing Arsenal at White Hart Lane it was going to be a nightmare getting back to Tottenham on the tube. Therefore I decided to try an alternative way home, got off the Circle line at Euston Square and for the first time got the bus home.

I knew there was a bus that went from there to Manor House after I’d done the same in reverse a few weeks ago, and when a 29 to Wood Green turned almost immediately it took me to Manor House from where I can walk home.

It was a bit mental on the way, with Finsbury Park packed with Arsenal fans and police vans, and then the Seven Sisters Road full of Spurs fans singing on the buses on the way up to the ground.

It was a great game (3-3 draw) which hopefully kept everyone reasonably happy, although the sirens through the night suggest otherwise.
