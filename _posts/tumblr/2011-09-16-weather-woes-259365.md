It was a wet day at home, but that’s nothing new. I’ve been trying to figure out how to add weather forecasts to my Bedside Clock app, and finally figured out how to do it. 

Basically I already use [Yahoo! Placefinder](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/) to get the location of the phone from its GPS coordinates, and it turns out that call already returns a WOE ID - which stands for “Where On Earth”. I can then hook that ID up to another Yahoo! service for the weather, and then with a bit of work get the weather forecast on the phone.

Really glad I learnt how to do that, as it’s probably a more useful feature than knowing the phase of the moon :-)
