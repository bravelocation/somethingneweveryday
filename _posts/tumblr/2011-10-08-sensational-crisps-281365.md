It was a very wet day up here in the North, but despite that Hilary was out in the wilds of Northumberland on the Haltwhistle Walking Festival. That meant we decided to have an evening in catching up on TV, and as it was “feast day” I decided to get some crisps in.

My previous favorite flavour has been Walkers Sensations ”Vinegar and Onion”, but after trying the new “Mexican Fiery Sweet Chipotle” flavour I may have changed my mind - definitely recommended (especially because Tesco has the on 2-for-1 right now!)
