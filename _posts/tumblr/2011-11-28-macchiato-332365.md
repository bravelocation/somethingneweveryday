Having a coffee at the Cardinal Cafe and I decided to try a macchiato, which I hadn’t had before.
To be honest, I’m not much of a coffee buff compared to some of my work colleagues (especially the Italian ones!) - and I didn’t really know what a macchiato was. I thought it was more along of a cappuccino, but as I now know it’s really just an espresso with a bit of milk in it.
I liked it, and I’ll definitely switch to it instead of my usual double espresso (or occasional latte) as I believe it sounds a little more sophisticated :-) I’ll still be having a nice cup of tea in the morning though.
