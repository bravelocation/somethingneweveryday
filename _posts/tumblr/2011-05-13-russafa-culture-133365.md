In the Easyjet in-flight magazine this month there is a [big article](http://traveller.easyjet.com/features/2011/05/valencia-ruzafa-bars-cafes-galleries) about the Russafa barrio in Valencia, and a mention of the [Sporting Club Russafa](http://www.sportingclubrussafa.com/), a combined gallery and workspace in an old Boxing club.

What I didn’t know was [Josie](http://www.josiemccoy.co.uk) had just moved into there as one of the artists, so yesterday I went there a couple of times - first to help carry some pictures and second for an opening night of a video installation of which I still know very little about.

In between a few (too many) beers and going to a combined Sushi/Tapas restaurant it was another great night out.
