As promised after the Facebook comments to my last country music post, I’ve made a playlist on Spotify with some good singalong country music classics to get you through the day :-)

I’m not a big user of Spotify, so this was the first time I’d made a playlist on there. Was very easy to do, and more impressively very easy to share too.
You can try it out [here](http://open.spotify.com/user/yeltzland/playlist/0FNsw27aH7WQIUJxYP1Sh1) - obviously you need the Spotify client. I expect most people won’t like it, but all I can say is give it a try and you may be surprised.
