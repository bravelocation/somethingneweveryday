Yesterday we went to the Newcastle v. Wigan game at St. James’s Park, the first time I’d been to a Premier League game there (only been to a friendly there before).

We were in the Sir John Hall Stand behind the goal as you can see from the photo I took before the kickoff. It was a decent atmosphere despite there not being many away fans there, and if the game wasn’t a great one, Cabaye’s winning goal was a cracker to keep Newcastle in their surprising top 4 position.
