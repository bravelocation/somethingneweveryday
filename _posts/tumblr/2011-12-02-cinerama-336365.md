I was a sick as I can remember on Friday which was no fun at all. I’ve been fighting what I thought was a cold all week, but I woke up in the middle of the night shaking with a very upset stomach, and then spent most of the day feeling very rough in bed.
Anyway, I was determined to do something new, as there was no way I was going to stop my streak now. Inspiration came when I got up to check my email, and I saw something from The Wedding Present mailing list, one of my favorite bands from back when I was younger who I’ve got back into recently.Singer Dave Gedge has another band called Cinerama, who I realised I’d never listened to, so using the power of Spotify I checked out a few tracks. I’ll definitely listen some more when I’m feeling better, but very happy to have squeezed something new into a horrible day.
