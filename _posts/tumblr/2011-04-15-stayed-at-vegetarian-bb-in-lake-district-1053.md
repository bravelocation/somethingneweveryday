It was Hilary’s birthday weekend, so we decided to spend a couple of days in the Lake District. We weren’t sure where to stay, but we saw and advert for a vegetarian B&B near Ambleside and we’d thought we’d give it a go - I’d never stayed at a solely vegetarian place before.
This one was called Yewfield and was quite nice - despite being right out in the middle of nowhere. The breakfast was decent - only 1 sausage though - and all in all was a pleasant place to stay despite having to drive anywhere.
