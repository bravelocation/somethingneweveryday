Headed up to Oxford Street after to work to buy a winter duvet (which is brilliant!) from M&S, and decided to pick up something to eat as well.

It’s always a pain getting the Victoria Line home when Arsenal are at home, but luckily there was an in-store eating area - a great idea and something I haven’t seen before in a shop like this.

Anyway I passed a pleasant enough half hour eating my food and reading my paper before heading home, and ticked off something new at the same time.
