I was having a reasonably late cup of tea in the office, and when I opened the fridge the only milk left was a 4 pint bottle with a purple top.
For the entertainment of my readers - and as I didn’t have any choice - I decided to risk it and add it to my cuppa, and to be honest it didn’t taste any difference.

Turns out it was homogenised milk, which was a new one for me. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(chemistry)) has a fun article on the process used which all sounds very unappealing, and further research doesn’t suggest that purple doesn’t always mean homogenised like green means semi-skimmed.

Fascinating eh?
