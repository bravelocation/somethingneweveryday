My friend Ada was in town to see The Mountain Goats, an American band I’d never heard of, so I thought I’d tag along for the night. The gig was at Koko in Camden where I’d never been before, and all in all it was a good night out.
The “band” was really one guy who’s been going for ages, who’s recently added a bassist and drummer to make a real band. They are a real cult band with some clearly devoted fans, and I’ll definitely check them out some more on MP3. I’ve hopefully embedded a YouTube video at the bottom.
The venue was pretty cool too, as it still had some of the decor of an old musical hall/theatre. £4.40 for a can of cider wasn’t so good though.
We then had a pint in the Lyttleton Arms opposite the venue, which will be vaguely amusing to anyone from Halesowen.
