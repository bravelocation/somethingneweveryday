We’ve been trying to sort out our New Year trip (now going to Valencia) which has been quite tricky as the usual budget airlines are already pretty booked up.
After a bit of searching turns out the best way is to take Air France from Newcastle to Valencia via Charles De Gaulle in Paris. Now I’ve done the Paris jaunt earlier in the year on the way to Seattle, but what was new was joining the Air France frequent flyer scheme when I bought our tickets.
Not sure if I’ll be using them that much, but hey why not? I’m at “Ivory” level which is a lot less rare than it sounds so no freebies just yet. I’m still smarting from losing my BA Silver Card, so I’m used to slumming it now :-)
