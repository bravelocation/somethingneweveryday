It was a nightmare journey back to Tottenham on Tuesday. I was knackered after a long day travelling down to that London and some late meetings, and then the Victoria line was going slower thatn I’ve ever known it - some signalling problems at Seven Sisters or something.

Anyway while I was sitting there I did something that I realised I’d never actually done before, and read my Kindle on the tube.

Very surprising but true - even though I’m in London 4 days most weeks I don’t keep my Kindle with me unless I’m travelling to or from home in the North. Those days I’ll have a full rucksack with me and almost no chance of having enough room in the crowds to even consider getting it out to read.

The combination of a very slow and half-empty train meant I could take advantage of having my Kindle with me, which definitely helped keep me awake!
