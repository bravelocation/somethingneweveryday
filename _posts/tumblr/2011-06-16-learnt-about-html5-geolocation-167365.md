I haven’t really looked into the new features of HTML5, so I thought I’d spend the train journey home learning about the geolocation features available.

I found the excellent [Dive Into HTML5 site](http://diveintohtml5.org/geolocation.html), and after following along with the examples I managed to get a very basic demo page working that looks up your location and then shows it on a map.

Interestingly - in Chrome at least - the Facebook control isn’t playing nice again. Also the location lookup didn’t really work on my mobile broadband (which I guess makes sense) and not at all in the crappy Windows Phone 7 browser.
