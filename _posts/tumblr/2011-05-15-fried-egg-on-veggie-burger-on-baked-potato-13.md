My last full day in Valencia for a while, and I have have a few things to choose from, including my first Valencia derby (0-0 vs. Levante which suited both teams and we predicted - without placing the bet - beforehand).
However, the real highlight was a new vegetarian restaurant called Copenhagen - both new to me and to Frank and Josie - where I had a totally brilliant food as the post title describes.
It was a really nice restaurant and quite different to other places Iâ€™ve been to in Valencia with less of a Spanish feel, but the food was very good and definitely recommended.
