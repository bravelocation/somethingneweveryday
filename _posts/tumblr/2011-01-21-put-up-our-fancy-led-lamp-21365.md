Put up our fancy LED lamp (21/365)
 
We’ve just bought a new lamp for our dining room, and it needed putting together. For my fellow geeky readers it’s a little bit interesting because it’s an LED lamp, rather than a bulb, and it outputs a slightly strange blue-white light that is quite relaxing and nice for reading.
I’ve attached a photo taken from my phone, but it doesn’t really capture the light colour very well. And yes, my next job is to put the picture up on the wall behind the chair :-)
