I recently bought a Kindle - which is completely brilliant - and already have found that the convenience of always having a few books available means I’m definitely reading a lot more.
I’ve just finished “ReWork" by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson - two of the founders of http://37signals.com/. I quite enjoyed the book, so I thought I’d do something new and write a review of it on Amazon.
I don’t think my review was particularly good, insightful or useful but I enjoyed writing it and definitely something I’ll try to get into the habit of doing.
You can see my initial attempt at being a critic on my page on the Amazon UK website
