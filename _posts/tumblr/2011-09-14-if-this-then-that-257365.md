Wednesday was my birthday (thanks for all the cards, Facebook messages and beer in the pub), and I’d expected to have a reasonably late night so I decided to get something new in the bag early on.
What I did was check out the brilliant new website at http://ifttt.com which stands for “If This Then That”. It’s is a workflow engine for web sites and services, and Scott Hanselman has posted a much better review than I would. I’d recommend both reading his thoughts and trying the site out. It’s such a simple but useful idea I’ve no idea why no-one thought of it before.
I’ve setup an alert to email me whenever it’s going to rain in Hexham the next day, which is useful but has fired every day so far :-(
