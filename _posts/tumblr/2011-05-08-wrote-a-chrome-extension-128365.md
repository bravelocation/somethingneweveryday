During a busy day watching football I thought I’d play about with some ideas I’ve been having at work and wrote my first Chrome extension.
To be honest it doesn’t do much right now and it’s an internal thing at the moment so I won’t share what it does, but it was surprisingly easy to do. My extension will inject some JavaScript and CSS into a webpage and add things into it, and the “content scripts" functionality let me do that with no issues at all - other than my usual aversion to the crappiness that is JavaScript and struggling with the vague madness that is closures.
Now I’ve got the taste for extensions I may try to write a vaguely useful one next!
