Back down in London again, but Frank and Josie hadnâ€™t gone back to Valencia yet so we went out for a curry and a few drinks after work in Stoke Newington.

To eat, we went to [Karnaphuli](http://www.bing.com/local/details.aspx?lid=YN1067x219882874&qt=yp&what=Karnaphuli&where=Stoke+Newington%2c+London&s_cid=ansPhBkYp02&mkt=en-gb&FORM=LARE) on Church Street. The food was good, offering a wide selection of dishes, although the service was pretty slow despite it being a Monday night with hardly anyone in there.
