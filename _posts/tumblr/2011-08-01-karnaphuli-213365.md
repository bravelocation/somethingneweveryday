Back down in London again, but Frank and Josie hadnâ€™t gone back to Valencia yet so we went out for a curry and a few drinks after work in Stoke Newington.
To eat, we went to Karnaphuli on Church Street. The food was good, offering a wide selection of dishes, although the service was pretty slow despite it being a Monday night with hardly anyone in there.
