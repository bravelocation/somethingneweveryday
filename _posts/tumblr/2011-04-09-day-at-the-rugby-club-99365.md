Usually on a trip back to the homelands I’d have gone to the football, but my friend Sid was hosting President’s Day at Old Halesonians Rugby Club so we went there instead.
It was a really good day out. We had a sit-down meal before the game which was pretty good (the chef asked me what I wanted as the only veggie in the place!), and there was an after dinner speaker who was really funny and JUST on the right side of acceptability!
The game itself was OK, but OH were winning pretty easily so after a first half enjoying the unseasonable sunshine we retired to the bar for the second half to watch the Grand National.
