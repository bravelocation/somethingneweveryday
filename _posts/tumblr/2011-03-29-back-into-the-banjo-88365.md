As you may or may not know I’ve been learning to play the banjo on and off for a couple of years now. I try to play my 5 string in a bluegrass/Earl Scruggs style and am OK at playing a very limited set of riffs and tunes.
However I’m determined to spend more time practicing, so yesterday I bought for the first time some music books to help me get inspired:
The Crow: New Songs for the Five-string Banjo
The Beatles for Banjo
For the first one, I have the album of Steve Martin (the comedian) songs who’s actually a great banjo player. The album is quite fun, and it will be great to try to play some of the songs. For the second, I’m definitely not a Beatles fan, but everyone knows the tunes and so it should be fun learning some singalong Jim Royle style tunes :-)
