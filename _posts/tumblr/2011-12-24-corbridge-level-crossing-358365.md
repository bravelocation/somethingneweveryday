Slightly telepathic one on Xmas Eve.
I was dropping Hilary off for her pre-Xmas drinks in Corbridge and was thinking I’d never had to stop at the level crossing just outside the town before. Then on the way back you can probably guess already that I did have to stop as a train went through.
Even weirder, when I picked her up a few hours later exactly the same happened - twice in the same day!
I now realise why I’d never seen it happen before because the barriers are only down for a few seconds, and there is only one train every half-hour or so, so the odds of it happening twice in a day are pretty high.
