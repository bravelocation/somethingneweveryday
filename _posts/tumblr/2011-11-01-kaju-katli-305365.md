My friend and work colleague Debashish came back from India yesterday, and brought with him some delicious Indian sweets. My desire for a “something new” was sadly stronger than my diet impulse, so I was tempted to try a piece of [Kaju Katli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaju_Katli), a cashew-based sweet.

It was definitely different, and the edible silver foil was slightly disconcerting too, but it’s always fun to try something new.
