A bit of a pattern appearing here, which seems against the spirit of the quest(!)

Midweek means heading out to a pub in Soho with work colleagues, me remembering I haven’t done anything new today and having to have a pint of something different.

This week’s emergency beer was [Woodforde’s Wherry Bitter](http://www.woodfordes.co.uk/html/our_beers.html), which appears to come from Norfolk and was perfectly acceptable which is about as much as I can remember.
