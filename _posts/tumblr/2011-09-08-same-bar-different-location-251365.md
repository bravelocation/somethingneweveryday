Last time I was in Wroclaw I was taken on a long vodka-fuelled pub crawl around the city centre by my very hospitable Polish colleagues. I decided that wasn’t the best idea this time seeing as I was doing some presenting the next day, but we did go for a nice team dinner and a drink afterwards.
I was convinced from the depths of my memory I’d been in the bar we were in before as it looked very familiar, but I was surprised it was so close to the hotel we had stayed in that time. However it turned out I was right - according to Konrad the bar we had been in had closed down, and then been recreated almost exactly the same in another part of town - where we were right now! A very strange thing to do, and very surprising I’d actually remembered that correctly.
