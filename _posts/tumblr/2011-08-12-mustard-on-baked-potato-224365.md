I’d been indoors working at home all day, and still hadn’t done sonething new. It was almost time to break out the emergency “stupid but novel” list, but then as I was getting ready to eat me tea, I thought I’d try something new and have some mustard on my baked potato.
Now I love mustard, and am having it increasing often in almost every meal, but I’d never made the obvious connection to put it on my baked potato before. Almost the perfect combination, and will do it all the time now!
