Back in the UK, and when entering via Heathrow Terminal 5 I used the ePassport line for the first time.
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it before, but usually I’m transferring to an internal flight up to Newcastle in a different part of immigration. All I had to do was first put in my picture page into the scanner,wait while it did some facial recognition for a few seconds and then I was back in the country. No quicker than the cursory glance the passport official usually gives you, but the line was definitely shorter.
Obviously you need an ePassport, but mine was issues in 2006 so I assume they are not that rare.
