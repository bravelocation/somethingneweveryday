I’m still trying out new brown sauces to replace my “hard to get in the North” Sainsbury’s version, and yesterday I tried out [HP Guinness Sauce](http://www.heinz.co.uk/sauce-partners/hp-sauce/products/hp-guinness).

Wasn’t certain what to expect, but it was actually pretty good. A little fruitier than a usual brown sauce, so definitely different but tasty all the same. That should probably last me the year now :-)
