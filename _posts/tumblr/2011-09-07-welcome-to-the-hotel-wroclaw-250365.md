I’m in Poland for work, in the lovely city of Wroclaw in the SW of the country. I’ve been here before, but for the first time I’m staying in the Hotel Wroclaw.
It was an interesting journey here, first on the reliably horrible RyanAir then to the hotel in a rapid taxi on what seemed a roundabout route. I believe back in the olden days the hotel was the best place to stay in Wroclaw, but nowadays it’s a little worse for wear but not too bad. We have meetings for 2 days in the hotel itself, which is very handy though.
