I’m in Poland for work, in the lovely city of [Wroclaw](http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?encType=1&where1=Wroclaw%2c+Poland&cp=51.121243~17.042704&qpvt=wroclaw) in the SW of the country. I’ve been here before, but for the first time I’m staying in the [Hotel Wroclaw](http://www.wroclaw-online.eu/38,orbis-hotel.php).

It was an interesting journey here, first on the reliably horrible RyanAir then to the hotel in a rapid taxi on what seemed a roundabout route. I believe back in the olden days the hotel was the best place to stay in Wroclaw, but nowadays it’s a little worse for wear but not too bad. We have meetings for 2 days in the hotel itself, which is very handy though.
