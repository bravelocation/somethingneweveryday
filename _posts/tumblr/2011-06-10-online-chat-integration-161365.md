We were throwing around ideas at work, and talk got onto how we could integrate IM/Chat into websites. I’d half remembered that Windows Live Messenger had a HTML version, so I thought I’d have a go at getting it working.
After following some useful advice at http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/developer/archive/2010/11/03/introducing-the-messenger-connect-chat-control.aspx I managed to get a very basic demo up and running at http://www.bravelocation.com/chatdemo
However, this wasn’t the easiest of things to do:
I just checked the page and it’s now complaining about a domain mismatch, even though there isn’t anywhere for me to set that
I had to remove any Facebook code from the page, as they were interfering with each other in some way
Not a great experience for the developer, and compared to adding Facebook or Twitter code to my site definitely a lot less well thought out. Disappointing really.
