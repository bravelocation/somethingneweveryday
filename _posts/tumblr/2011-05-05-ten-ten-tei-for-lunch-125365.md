We had an internal lunch meeting, and ended up at Ten Ten Tei, a Japanese restaurant just around the corner in Brewer Street - another place really close I hadn’t been before.
According to the mixed reviews on the London Eating site, it’s a typical place you might find in a Japanese suburb. I’ve never been to Japan (yet), but it was a nice and simple place and the tofu and rice I had was very tasty. The sashimi the other guys had looked fantastic almost made me wish I ate fish. Almost.
