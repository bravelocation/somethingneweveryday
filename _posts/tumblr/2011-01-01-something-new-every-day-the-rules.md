It’s New Year’s Day, so it’s the perfect time for starting ambitious but vaguely plausible projects.

The challenge I’m setting myself is to try to do something I haven’t done before on all 365 days of 2011.

In my rules, anything counts as “something new” if it’s a new experience for me, so it could be something as trivial as walking a different way to work, cooking something I haven’t made before, learning something new about software development, …

Why am I doing this? Several reasons really, but most of all I want to force myself to keep trying out new ideas and experiences. By making this a public challenge I’m hoping it will keep up my enthusiasm throughout the year. It will also be a reasonably interesting daily diary of 2011, but hopefully not too much like this video: 

I’ll be using the Twitter Hashtag #new365 for posts in the project, and would be very happy if you want to play along too!

In a vaguely recursive sort of way, me setting up this project is the first new thing I’ve done this year, so I’m counting this as my first post (1/365)
