Nothing particularly exciting to report, but we did go to Browns Bar & Brasserie just across from the office for the first time. Full of lots of corporate types as you’d expect, but they did have a reasonably different menu of beers available (which I’m saving for another rainy day!)
Definitely think I’m a bit boozed out right now, so hopefully this will be the last pub-related entry for a while.
