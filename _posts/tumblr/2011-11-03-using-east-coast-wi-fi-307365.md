First time writing using the thing I’m posting about, as I’m trying out the on train Wi-fi from East Coast on the journey home.

I usually use my mobile broadband, but decided to burn 50 frequent traveller points on using the train’s connection. However, to be honest it’s not great. The wifi has dropped maybe 5 times in the 2.5 hours I’ve been on here, and when it is connected it’s no faster than my 3G connection.

Oh well, worth a try and I got a new thing out of it.
