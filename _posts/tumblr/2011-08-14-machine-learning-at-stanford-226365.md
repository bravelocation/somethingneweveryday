This month’s Wired magazine (US edition obviously) contained an interesting article on how education is being transformed by online learning videos. It also contained a sidebar of interesting learning sites, so I thought I’d check some out.
What I found was a set of videos from a Machine Learning lecture course at Stanford University on YouTube Edu.
I’ve been reading around the subject for a while, but watching a lecture on video was new - and it was interesting how technology in the lecture hall has changed - never had PowerPoint and videos in my day lol.
