A day full of meetings (28/365)
As you may know I’m in the US at the moment for work, which means visiting the Bing HQ in Bellevue, WA

We always try to make the most of our visits by arranging as many meetings as possible, but Friday was the first time I can ever remember that I had a day completely full of meetings. I’ve added a picture of my Outlook calendar to remember the momentous day, with the top-secret details of what we were discussing redacted :-)
