We trying to make the most of Soho before we move offices soon, so we went to another new place for lunch - Vitao on Wardour Street.
Itâ€™s a healthy vegetarian sort of place, and decent value (for Soho). There was a selection of dhals, rice dishes and salads which was all pretty decent. Supposedly they have had all sorts of celebrities eat there, but there was no sign of them when we went in.
