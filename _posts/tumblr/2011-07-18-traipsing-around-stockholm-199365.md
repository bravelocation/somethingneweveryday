Hard to pick the best new thing after a great day in Stockholm, so I’m not going to.
It’s a beautiful place, with some beautiful buildings built in the many islands that make up the city. We did a boat tour around the main waterways which really give you a good sense of the place, and spent a while browsing around Gamla Stan, the original old town.
Probably the most impressive was the Vasamuseet, a museum for a 17th century war ship that was salvaged from the harbour almost intact a few years ago.
More good food and a couple of beers in town rounded off an excellent day.
