It was getting late in the day and I still hadnâ€™t done anything new. Looking in the fridge I had some birds-eye chiilis, so I decided to do something experimental and make a sandwich with one of them (plus some false-meat ham and pickle).
I was a bit worried that it was going to be horrible - even though I love hot food - but actually it was delicious. It was quite fiery but definitely not too hot (for me), and complemented the pickle really well. Definitely will have it again.
