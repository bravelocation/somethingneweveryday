Tuesday’s Munich excursion meant a trip to a local [Christmas market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market). This was great fun, as I had some [Glühwein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gl%C3%BChwein) - basically some mulled wine but much nicer than the UK variety - and then an interesting star-shaped bakery item from a stall.

A really nice way to start off the evening, which continued in a local Greek restaurant and then a reasonably early night.

Munich is great!
