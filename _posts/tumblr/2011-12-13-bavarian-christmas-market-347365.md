Tuesday’s Munich excursion meant a trip to a local Christmas market. This was great fun, as I had some Glühwein - basically some mulled wine but much nicer than the UK variety - and then an interesting star-shaped bakery item from a stall.
A really nice way to start off the evening, which continued in a local Greek restaurant and then a reasonably early night.
Munich is great!
