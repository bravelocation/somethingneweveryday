It’s Saturday so that usually means two things:
I try some experimental cooking
I have a veggie sausage sandwich for lunch
This week I decided to combine the two and make my own sausages.
A bit of research found what looked like a good recipe on the BBC website by Simon Rimmer of TV’s “Something For the Weekend”. I customised it by adding a bit of chilli and mustard to the sausage mix, and it turned out fantastically well.

Presentation a little poor as usual, as we decided to grill them on the George Foreman which squashed them down quite a bit - but the taste was superb. With the onion gravy mentioned in the recipe as well as some mashed potatoes and peas, it almost made up for the disaster of Newcastle losing to Stevenage at the same time :-)
