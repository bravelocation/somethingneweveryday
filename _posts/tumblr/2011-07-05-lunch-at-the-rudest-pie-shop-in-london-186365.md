Lunch is already becoming an issue at our new office in Victoria, as our choice of venues is much worse than in Soho.
We ventured out to try and find somewhere new and interesting, and ended up on Struton Ground, where there is a street market and a few cafes and restaurants. I went for a pie in a place I think was called Stiles, and the service was atrocious. One server just stared at me rather than asking what I wanted even though heâ€™d called me over. Very bizarre. It was a bit freaky and Paul decided not to have anything because of it, although I eventually escaped with a reasonable vegetable pastie.
Will not be going there again.
