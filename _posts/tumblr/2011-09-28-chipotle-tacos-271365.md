Another stupidly long day at work, so by the time I’d finished I wanted something decent to eat and a beer.
I really wanted to go to Chipotle, but hadn’t done anything new yet, so after wavering a little I decided to go anyway but change my usual order of a burrito and have tacos instead.
The very helpful server explained there were both soft tacos - basically mini burritos - and crispy ones, so to make it more novel I went with the crispy ones. They were OK, but seemed a lot less filling than a burrito (probably more diet friendly though), so this will almost certainly be a one-time experiment only.
