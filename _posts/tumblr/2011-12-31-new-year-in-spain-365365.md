Made it! Saw the year out in style by spending a great day eating and drinking in Valencia.
There were actually lots of new things done, but the most memorable was the Spanish tradition of eating 12 grapes as it turns midnight, one on each chime of the clock in Madrid (equivalent of Big Ben’s chimes). This wasn’t the easiest of things to do especially after a few solid hours eating and drinking behind us, but a great tradition none the less.
Thanks to Frank and Josie for arranging for us to go to Jamon Session, and also to Frank for making the tree-mendous Onion Bhajis and Dhal.
One more post to come when I’ll try to write a suitable conclusion to the year of new things - but it’ll have to wait a bit until I feel a bit less hungover.
