Following on from [an earlier theme](/wrote-a-book-review-on-amazon-5365) of trying to contribute more to the t’Internet, today I wrote my first [review](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/yeltzland/) and rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Almost certainly you’ve been to the site before, but if not it’s a really good movie website where the reviews and ratings of the films are all crowd-sourced.  The large number of users means the ratings are usually a pretty good indication of the quality of the film.

Anyway I added my review of rating of True Grit that we saw the other night.

What was hard was trying to write something that might be deemed useful without sounding like a pretentious arsehole. Hopefully I didn’t fall into that trap, but I don’t think my review was any good. Still, never hurts to try something outside of your comfort zone!
