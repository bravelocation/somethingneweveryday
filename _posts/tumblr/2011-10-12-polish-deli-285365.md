Still felt a bit rough yesterday and left work a bit early, so I thought I best do something new on the way back to the flat before I flaked out.

What I did was go into the Polish deli near Seven Sisters tube station to see what it was like. There is a big Polish community in the area, and as youâ€™d expect the shop was basically full of Polish food items. There were lots of interesting things to try, but in my slightly fragile state I decided to go for some mango flavoured green tea in a can for medicinal reasons.

Not sure if it was the green tea that did the trick, but I do feel a bit better this morning.
