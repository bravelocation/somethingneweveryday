Thanks to colleagues Ward (who brought them from the US) and Paul (who convinced me to try them) I ate a sea salt chocolate from Trader Joes yesterday.

They were exactly what it sounds like they are - fancy chocolates with salt on top. A very strange taste, but actually quite nice - although the salt stopped you wanting another one.
