 As you may know I’m a big fan of Chipotle, and am a regular in what I think is the only one in the UK on Charing Cross Road, London. However I’d never been to one in the US, something I rectified tonight.
We’d been to the cinema to see Green Hornet 3D on the IMAX in Lincoln Square Cinema in Bellevue and wanted something tasty and quick to eat - so Chipotle was the perfect choice. It was very similar to the UK version, except for a couple of minor differences:
The menu boards showed the calories (not too bad!)
They had a kids menu, and drinks were also more obviously placed
The food was just about identical. The hot salsa didn’t seem quite as hot as at home, although that could well have just been my expectations after a week of “5-star spicy” food that isn’t very hot at all.
