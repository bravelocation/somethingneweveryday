I posted about my mustard obsession before, but as part of my ongoing diet it’s been a while since I’ve incorporated it in a new way. However on Friday I added mustard to the toast that I poured my baked beans over for the first time.
Such an obvious thing to do, and it added a nice zing to what’s been a pretty common meal over the last 9 weeks. Now I’ve done it once, I can’t imagine eating beans without mustard now.
