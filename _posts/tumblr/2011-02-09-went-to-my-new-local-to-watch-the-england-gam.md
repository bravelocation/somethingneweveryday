Bit of a slow week on the exciting new experiences front, but I’m still sticking with it.

I thought I’d go to the pub around the corner from my new London flat to watch the Denmark v England match tonight. I wasn’t particularly bothered about the game - although it turned out reasonable for a friendly - but more in preparation for more interesting games coming up. I can get Sky Player on my laptop, but sometimes it’s just better to watch the game in the pub, and with the Champions League coming around soon I need to see how my new local will work out.

It’s called the [Woodbury Tavern](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Woodbury-Tavern/187491657942307), and is a very ordinary pub (which is not a bad thing at all!). It’s a decent size, reasonably cheap beer, and best of all has at least 4 large TVs around the place all showing sport. Whilst watching the England game I could also keep an eye on Scotland v N. Ireland. This is very good.

The pub’s [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Woodbury-Tavern/187491657942307) has some pictures of both the interior and the outside which capture it pretty well. It was quiet in there, and I definitely think I’ll be going back - especially when new local team Spurs play AC Milan next week.
