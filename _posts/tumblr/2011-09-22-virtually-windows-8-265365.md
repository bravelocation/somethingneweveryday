I thought I’d spend my long train journey home setting up Windows 8 on my laptop so I could have a play around with it.
A bit of searching found some instructions on installing in an Oracle VirtualBox, and with a bit of effort and a couple of false trails I managed to get it up and running. VirtualBox didn’t play very nicely with my mobile broadband so I was a bit limited on what I could do - since rectified now I’m back home.
First impressions are good, although not 100% sure about the Metro interface and a non-touch screen PC. I hope to play about with building some test Metro-style apps soon.
