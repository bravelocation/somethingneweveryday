After installing the latest Windows Phone SDK, I thought I’d have a go at updating my blog-famous Bedside Clock app.
What I hadn’t done for a while is look at the app reviews, and a few people were complaining about the UI changes I’d made in v2. To be fair they had a point, but in my defence I only really developed it for myself and I’m just playing about. You do get what you pay for.
Anyway, I thought I’d try to set the application bar my app uses so it wasn’t shown all the time, but found out something new and a bit stupid. In landscape mode the application bar can’t be minimized - no idea why - so that didn’t work at all.
It made me think of a better solution and I’ll get to learn something new then when I implement that - bonus!
