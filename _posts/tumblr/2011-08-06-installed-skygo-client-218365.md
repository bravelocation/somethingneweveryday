Sky have recently rebranded their online TV service to SkyGo, and have released a new desktop client for watching movies offline, so I decided to give it a go.

I’ve been using their live streaming service quite a lot recently, as it’s perfect for watching Sky Sports when I’m down in the flat in London. It’s always been pretty reliable, but I’ve never considered using it for anything else.

However when I looked at the list of films available for download, it seemed a good thing to try on my usual 4 hour train journey home on a Thursday. This may count as something new then if I’m desparate (we will see!)
