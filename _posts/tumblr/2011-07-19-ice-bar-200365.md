Ice Bar (200/365)
Another great day in Stockholm but the absolute highlight was going to the Ice Bar in the hotel.
It’s made by the same people who make the famous Ice Hotel and supposedly there are only 6 bars like this in the world. To state the bleeding obvious it was bloody freezing in there. The glasses were made out of ice, and beforehand we thought it was a bit mean only letting you stay an hour but after 40 minutes and two stiff drinks we’d had enough - and we’d stayed in the longest!
Hilary’s always wanted to go to stay in the Ice Hotel, but I’ve never been keen, and after this - although it was brilliant fun - I’m definitely not going!
