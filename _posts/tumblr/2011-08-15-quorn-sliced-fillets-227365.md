My diet is now officially 2 days in, and I’m trying to eat more protein and less carbs and fat than usual. Have to wait until Saturday’s first weigh-in to see if it’s working.

Anyway I was looking for something suitable at the supermarket, and decided to try something new; Quorn Sliced Fillets, which fitted the bill nicely. They were a little dull, but with some beans they were fine and made me feel I was actually dieting :-)

One of the dullest new things so far I’m afraid, but this is not easy!
