I fancied trying making some biscuits yesterday, and a recipe for Jammy Dodgers in The Times supplement seemed a great idea to try.

First glitch was the recipe called for some semolina flour, which wasnâ€™t to be found anywhere in Hexham. However we guessed it was more for texture that anything so we substituted some ground almonds we had in the cupboard.

Hilary did a great job of cutting the hearts, and although they were more shortbready than shop bought Jammy Dodgers, they were pretty good.
