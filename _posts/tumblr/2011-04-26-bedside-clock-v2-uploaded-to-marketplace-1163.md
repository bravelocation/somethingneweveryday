How many posts can I wring out of one thing? Well not too many more out of my over-designed Bedside Clock app as version 2 is finally finished and has been uploaded to the Marketplace.
It was the first time I’d done a version upgrade (the new thing), and it was slightly more painful than expected as because I’d added proper multi-language support it wanted me to add multi-lingual comments to the descriptions shown in Zune too. I again used the Bing Translate website to do this, so apologies if the quality isn’t very good :-(
If you are using the app, then hopefully it will pass the testing phase and be available for download very soon.
