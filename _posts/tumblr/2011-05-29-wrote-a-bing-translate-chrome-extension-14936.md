One of the great things about working at Bing in London is working with interesting people from all around the world. Obviously when they post things on Facebook sometimes they are in their native language so not so easy for this poor linguist to understand.
Now IE8/9 has a built-in context menu to let you highlight the text and get Bing Translate to translate it, but I mostly use Chrome as my browser nowadays. Therefore I decided to build my own Chrome Extension to do exactly the same.
It was pretty easy as Bing Translate has a nice service endpoint which returns JSON, and Chrome allows you to add extensions on the right-click context menu.
It’s simple and does the job, and after paying $5.00 to Google to join their developer program I’ve shared it for everyone to download on the Chrome web store.
If you give it a go, let me know what you think.
