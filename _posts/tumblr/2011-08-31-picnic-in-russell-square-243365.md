It was my flatmate Ben’s 30th birthday and to celebrate his partner Matt had organised a surprise evening out with friends, including a film and then a picnic in the park in Russell Square.
It was a really nice evening, and I think Ben really enjoyed it once he’d recovered from the shock! My highlight was the lanterns/hot air ballons that someone had brought that were brilliant, despite the attempt by the park keeper to spoil the fun.
Happy Birthday Ben!
