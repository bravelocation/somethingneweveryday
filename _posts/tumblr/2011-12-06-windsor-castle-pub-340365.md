First new pub in a while - it was Stephanie’s “21st” so a few of us went for a drink after work in The Windsor Castle pub behind Westminster Cathedral.

It’s a whole new world on the other side of Victoria Street from our office, quite residential and not too far from Channel 4’s offices. The pub used to be called The Cardinal as you can hopefully see from the outdated Google Street View below. It has a massive room in the back, and despite being busy was a nice place for a pint and a chat.
