Decided to make something nice and warming, so I made some vegetable ramen which I hadn’t done before.

I just added some shittake mushrooms, spring onions, a little ginger, soy sauce and 2 chopped chillis into some vegetable stock, simmered for 30 mins then added some stir-fried noodles into the mix and served.

It was actually very spicy as the chillis were very strong, but that’s not really a bad thing. Very nice on another very cold day.
