I had a spreadsheet I wanted to share with a few friends on a project we’re working on. Previously we’ve been posting it around by email, but we wanted something we could easily collaborate on.
I’ve been using Google Docs for a while now, which is OK especially for my own simple spreadsheets. However to try something new I decided to give http://docs.com a go.
If you haven’t heard of it, docs.com is a joint venture between Microsoft and Facebook which basically allows you to share Office documents with friends on Facebook. 
It was trivially easy to upload an existing file which looks like it’s been imported perfectly. I then added access to a select group of friends, and we’re done. To make it even easier I made a new private Facebook group to manage the access control, so any group member can view and edit the spreadsheet.
I’d definitely recommend this as a very simple way of online sharing, and unlike other Microsoft solutions doesn’t require everyone to have a Windows Live ID. It’s fascinating to see the partnership between Microsoft and Facebook working so well.
