I was late, it was raining and I had done anything new yet. Desperate measures were called for, so I thought I’d walk down Tottenham High Street to Stamford Hill to the Sainsburys there.
It’s actually a much better place to shop for veggie stuff than Tescos at Seven Sisters, so despite getting a little wetter than I needed to it was probably worth it - at least to keep the streak going for one more day.
I have nothing interesting for today and I’m perched in front of the TV watching Arsenal v Barcelona, so don’t hold your breath for better things on day 47 :-(
