My friend O works at a startup called DishOnIt, which is a service about discovering and sharing individual dishes at restaurants.
I was one of the first users helping to beta test the service, and on Friday I checked out their Windows Phone 7 app. It’s a really nice experience and the UX is actually brilliantly designed. It works really well and if you’re developing apps I’d definitely advise checking it out to see what they’ve done. 

The only drawback - as in many similar networking apps - is reaching that critical mass of data. There seems to be lots of data in and around Washington State but not so much yet in other areas. Hopefully that will come soon. I know they also have an iPhone app too which obviously I haven’t seen if that’s your smartphone of choice.
