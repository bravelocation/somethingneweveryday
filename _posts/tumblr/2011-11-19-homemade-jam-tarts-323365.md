Homemade Jam Tarts (323/365)I hadn’t done any baking for a while, and I had a fancy for some jam tarts so I thought I’d have a go at baking some. 
I didn’t realise how easy it was going to be, otherwise I would have made them before. I just got some ready made shortcrust pastry, cut out the pieces, filled with jam then put in the oven.
Lovely with some clotted cream.
