I’m doubtful I’ve ever gone for cocktails on a Monday evening before, but for certain I had some new drinks while doing so!
We went to Be@t One in Soho for slightly unknown reasons, and it being happy hour from 5-8 meant we slightly over-indulged. I had a “Fire Starter” (new), “Johnny Cash” (new and totally excellent), an “Old Fashioned” (had before with @pflinton in Bellevue) and a “Manhattan” (probably had before).
They all had pretty big measures of alcohol so we were all a little worse for wear, but it must have been the fruit involved as actually I felt completely fine the morning after. Very strange and welcome!
