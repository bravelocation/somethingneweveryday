I am the muffin man (57/365)
My recent baking experiments have been a bit disappointing, so I’m glad to say I’m back on form with some excellent home-made banana nut muffins made yesterday.
After checking out a few online recipes, I ended up adapting one found in a book by Mary Berry we have at home, adding mashed up bananas and some finely chopped flax and nuts. Very easy to make, and despite a couple of them expanding well out of their cases in the oven, I managed to get 10 really good ones out.
Would definitely add in more than one banana to the mix next time, but overall deemed a success.
You can also see I decided to play them in a 4-3-2-1 Christmas tree formation.
