On the way home from Edinburgh we went to Rosslyn Chapel, a very interesting place most famous for being where the climax of The Da Vinci Code takes place.
The chapel was much smaller than I expected, and the carvings inside were unbelieveably detailed. Unfortunately I didnâ€™t uncover any mysteries that could be spun into a blockbuster novel.
