Sunday was the last day of my fortnight’s holiday, so we decided to go to the Metro Centre and watch the final Harry Potter film.

This was the first time I’d been to the 3D IMAX there, but another (slightly) more interesting new thing was that we went to the [Handmade Burger Company](http://handmadeburger.co.uk/) afterwards. It’s an interesting place with a big choice of different burgers including 7 different veggie ones! There were pretty good and completed a good 2 weeks of not the most healthy eating.
