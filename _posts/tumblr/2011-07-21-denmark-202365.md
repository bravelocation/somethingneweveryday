Our European tour continues with my first ever visit to Denmark.

We got the train down from Stockholm to Copenhagen, which was a pleasant enough trip through the Swedish countryside. It was remarkably similar all the way down - trees, the odd farm with red house and many lakes. 

We’re staying at the [Hotel Kong Arthur](http://www.kongarthur.dk/uk-index.php) in Copenhagen which is quite nice and has a cool name :-)

The real problem so far has been the weather - it’s been pretty much torential rain since we got here. We started to head into town but after 10 minutes we were soaked through, so we turned straight around and headed back to the hotel to dry out before having a decent meal in one of the hotel restaurants.
Hopefully it will clear up a bit for the rest of our stay here.
