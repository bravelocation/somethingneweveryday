Yesterday was census day, and like the rest of the country I filled in what is mostly information with a bit of effort the government already knows about me.
The new thing was filling it out electronically on the Census website, which worked out very well. It was much quicker to fill in (my writing is very rusty nowadays) and the site was actually really well designed.
Rumour has it this could be the last ever census as it does seem anachronistic in this electronic era, and I can’t believe it’ll be the most efficient way in 10 years time to collect this information.
