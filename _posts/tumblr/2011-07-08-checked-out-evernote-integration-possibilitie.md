I’ve been a big user of Evernote for a while now for keeping notes on everything, mainly because it’s a lot more cross-platform than Office OneNote.
However, what I didn’t realise until Friday was there an extensive API you can use to integrate other apps or services with Evernote. I spent an interesting half an hour playing about with the scripting interface, and had a few ideas of other ways I could automatically add other information into notes.
Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll have time to get an entry together for the upcoming Evernote Developer Competition which is offering impressively big prizes, but I’m even more impressed with the way the Evernote team is gradually turning their program into a platform.
(P.S. This entry has been written in an extremely jetlagged and sleep deprived state, so if it makes even less sense than usual that’s the reason!)
