I’ve been a manager on and off for several years, but yesterday was the first time I’d ever been on a management training course.
It was called “Situational Leadership II” (strangely there is no SL I) and despite having very low expectations it was actually really good. The course was well taught, the interactive elements were just at the right level and I actually learnt a lot. Definitely recommended for any MS people who haven’t been on it.
