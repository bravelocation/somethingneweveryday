Friday was our last day in Edinburgh and surprisingly the sun came out, so we spent most of the day in the pub. We went to a couple of places I hadn’t been before, and the most interesting was Kays Bar in the New Town.
It’s a tiny place tucked away on a back street, but was a great find and very friendly - highly recommended.
