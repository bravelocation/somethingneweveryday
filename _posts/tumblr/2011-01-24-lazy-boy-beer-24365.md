I had an insanely productive day today at work, which was very surprising given that I’m still pretty jet-lagged. However I can’t really divulge what I was doing due to trade secrets and risk of boring everyone rigid. However, what I did do was have a new beer I hadn’t tried before when we went out for dinner this evening.

It was pretty wet so we didn’t want to venture too far from the hotel, we went to [Chantanee](http://www.chantanee.com/), a nice Thai restaurant about 2 blocks away. The menu said they had 8 local draft beers on, and when the waiter was telling me what they were and mentioned a “Lazy Boy” that sounded the one for me.

Looking at the [brewery’s website](http://www.lazyboybrewing.com/) I think I had an Amber Ale, which was pretty decent - a typical microbrewery beer found in Washington State. definitely worth another taste next time I see it on.
