I was walking down Old Compton Street in Soho on the way to work, and down the end of the road was what looked like a giant Dormobile, some kind of truck with a converted roof and a high glass front.
Now you see all sorts of strange things in Soho, but when I got a bit closer I could see a giant “Ministry of Technology” logo on the side of the truck. Couldn’t understand that as in my usual universe there isn’t such a thing.
As I carried on walking I then saw two film cameras filming what was going on and it made a lot more sense - it must be some sort of retro sci-fi film set. So as the lorry drove towards me I made sure I was in shot as it turned the corner near the cameras :-)
I have no idea what they were actually doing, but look out for me in a movie out sometime in the next 12 months set in Central London. I think I’ll get an agent just in case.
