After what seems like a very long wait, developers are finally allowed to upload their apps for the latest version of Windows Phone 7, so on Tuesday I uploaded the new, slightly improved version of my Bedside Clock app.

The only real issue I had was the upload tool kept moaning I was supporting fewer languages in my new version than in the old. This confused me for a long while, until I found a [very useful article by Pawan Agrawal](View Larger Map) that pointed out I needed to set the default language differently.
Right now (Thursday 25th) the app is still going through certification, but hopefully it will be available soon for anyone whoâ€™s upgraded their phone.
