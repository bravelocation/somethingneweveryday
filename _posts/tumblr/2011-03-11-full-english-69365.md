After Wednesday’s [disappointing dinner](/piccadilly-stale-sandwich-68365), I was absolutely starving in the morning and with the prospect of an 8 hour meeting ahead I needed a decent breakfast. So I did something I’m pretty certain I haven’t done before and had a veggie fry-up on the way to work.

I went to [Cafe Rendevous](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/cafe-rendezvous-london), a place I’d walked past a few times when I used to walk in to the office from Pimlico. My meeting was in Victoria, so it seemed a decent place to go. The veggie breakfast was fine and really hit the spot.

Hopefully I won’t be making a habit of this, but sometimes you just need a good breakfast!
