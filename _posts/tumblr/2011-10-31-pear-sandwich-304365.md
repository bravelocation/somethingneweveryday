Needed some food and couldn’t be arsed to do much, so I popped into M&S in Cardinal Place to see what I could find. The most exciting - and new - food I could find was a cheese, chutney and *pear* sandwich.

As you have probably figured out I’m a big banana fan, but never had pera on a sandwich before. It was really nice, and complimented the cheese much better than I thought.

I may now have exhausted the “fruit in a sandwich” novelties :-)
