More work on my hack day mobile phone app I mentioned in the previous post, this time adding in tube departure times using the TFL Data API - something I hadn’t tried before.
The API is nicely designed, and exposes a lot of real-time information that could make a really interesting mobile phone app (not saying mine is yet!). The site is a bit off putting saying you need permission to be approved etc. but I got access within just a few minutes of my application and I was soon up and running.
I may well look at using this data in a form I can share with people a bit more widely.
