Now I’m sharing a place with 2 flatmates, sometimes their partners and occasionally other friends, I thought I might invest in a dressing gown for wandering about the flat in.

Now I’ve never had a dressing gown before, and I suspect I’m showing my age but it’s brilliant! I got it from M&S and it’s really warm when I make the trek to the bathroom first thing. No idea how I spent so much of my life without one.

Before you ask, obviously it’s urban because I’ll only wear it in the city. I’ll continue to prance around in my underwear in the country :-)
