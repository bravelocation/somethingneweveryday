Spent Sunday in Seattle (Bellevue really) mostly eating a big breakfast, drinking beer and watching football (US style) on TV. However in-between all that I watched my first full length film on YouTube - the excellent [Life In a Day](http://www.youtube.com/lifeinaday).

You’ve probably heard of the movie, which is made up of lots of ordinary user’s videos of one day last year. If you haven’t seen it, it’s really good - superb editing makes the ordinary seem very profound and at times beautiful. Very highly recommended.
