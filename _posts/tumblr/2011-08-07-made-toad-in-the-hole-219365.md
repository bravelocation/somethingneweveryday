Made Toad in the Hole (219/365)
Haven’t done an experimental cooking for a while, so after having a delicious Toad in the Hole in Edinburgh a few days back, I decided to have a go at doing my own.
I found a nice recipe on Jamie Oliver’s website (obviously using veggie sausages), and despite never having made Yorkshire Pudding before it actually turned out well as you can see from the picture.
With the torrential rain outside all weekend, it was nice to have a hearty winter meal :-)
