Shopping in Tesco on my way home as usual, and for the first time I used my credit card contactless by simply swiping it on the machine.
I’m not sure why I haven’t used it before, but I think it’s because I believe it only can be used for small payments of less than 10 pounds, and generally I’d probably use cash in those circumstances. It was pretty cool (in a nerdy way) and obviously much quicker than using chip and pin.
