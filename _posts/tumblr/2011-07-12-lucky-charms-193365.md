More US food related excitement. In the cafeteria in Bing HQ they offer a wide selection of breakfast options, so I opted for trying [Lucky Charms](http://www.luckycharms.com/) cereal.

I’d heard of them (on The Simpsons I think) but never tried them before. To be honest they weren’t very nice, very sweet cereal plus marshmallow pieces.
Not an experiment to repeat.
