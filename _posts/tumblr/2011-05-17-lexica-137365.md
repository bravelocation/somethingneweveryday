Just about every day I spend probably 30 mins. at least doing the puzzles in The Times. In the last few years the number in there has grown and grown, so much in fact that it’s impossible to do all of them without spending several hours hard at it.
Anyway, on Tuesday I tackled a puzzle type I hadn’t done before - Lexica. It’s a sort of combination of a crossword and sudoku, but hard to explain. I’d only ever glanced at the rules before so didn’t know immediately what to do, so previously I’d usually ignore it. However after a couple of minutes reading it all became clear - and was actually quite a nice challenge. I’m not sure it will fit into my daily routine, but will definitely try it again for a change.
