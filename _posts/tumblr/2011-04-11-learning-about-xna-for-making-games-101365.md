As regular readers know I’ve been boring you silly about my Bedside Clock Windows Phone 7 app. It was just something I made to learn about the platform, and has been really useful in that respect, but I need a new project.

I’m not sure exactly what I’m going to do yet, but I’m seriously thinking about a game next. However to do this I probably need to write it using XNA a development framework you can also write Xbox games in.

Anyway my new thing was to read a beginner’s guide to XNA I found at [http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/XNA-for-Silverlight-developers-Part-0-Why-should-I-care.aspx](http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/XNA-for-Silverlight-developers-Part-0-Why-should-I-care.aspx) which was really help explaining the basics - well recommended for novices in this area like myself.
