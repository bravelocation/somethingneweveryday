Another new place for lunch this time Kua ‘Aina, a Hawaiian Sandwich Grill just off Carnaby Street.
It was a pretty awsome place, serving burgers and grilled sandwiches. Paul’s fish option looked good, and although the veggie options were a little limited the grilled halloumi sandwich I had was very good. Definitely recommended.
