I wanted to do something special for the 100th post, but was also reasonably hungover from [a few drinks the day before](/day-at-the-rugby-club-99365). I knew I’d be spending most of the day travelling back down to London, then kipping and watching sport, so I took an early opportunity to try marmalade on toast at Ada’s first thing.

I’d had marmalade for almost certainly the first time a few months ago, and quite enjoyed it, so when there was no raspberry jam available - my usual spread of choice - I thought I’d give it a go. It was OK, but definitely not as nice as jam as it’s probably too sharp a taste for me. However I wasn’t in the best state to appreciate it so may have to give it another go.
