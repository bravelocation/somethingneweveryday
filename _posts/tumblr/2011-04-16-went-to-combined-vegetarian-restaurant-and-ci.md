For Hilary’s birthday on Saturday we headed into Ambleside and went to the most brilliant combination for a night out - a posh vegetarian restaurant with a cinema upstairs.

It’s called [Fellini’s](http://www.fellinisambleside.com/) and is a fantastic idea. We bought a combined meal for 2 with cinema tickets, had an excellent meal and then could wander upstairs with our drinks to the small studio cinema.

The food was really good - you can see the menu [here](http://fellinisambleside.com/pdf/fellinisMenu.pdf) - and we went to see Oranges and Sunshine, a worthy but slightly dull film about children in care being deported to Australia in the 50’s and 60’s without their parents knowledge.

With a nice bottle of wine we had a lovely night, and it’s definitely recommended if you’re in the area.
