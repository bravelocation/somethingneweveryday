After wandering around Soho looking for somewhere new for lunch, Paul and myself found Wheat, a new Thai takeaway place on Broadwick Street.
It didn’t look too promising, as they only had one veggie option (Red Curry), and when Paul asked for soup it turned out they didn’t have any. However, the food was actually quite tasty and in particular the rice was very nice, even though there was a little too much of it.
Reasonably recommended, although with all the competition around the area I don’t expect them to last very long :-(
