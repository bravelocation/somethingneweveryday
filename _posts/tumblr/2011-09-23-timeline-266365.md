Like half the rest of the world I’ve been playing about with the new features Facebook announced this week, and in particular yesterday I setup my timeline page.
From a technical point of view, the new Open Graph API is really impressive and opens up a whole world of integration not available before. If this takes off - and no reason to think it won’t - Facebook are going to hold absolutely masses of personal information on everyone, and have the most powerful platform ever for monetizing that knowledge. A little bit frightening from a business point of view, but as a user the new features are very compelling. 
The timeline feature is very nice, although very close to exactly what Memolane already offers, and offers a really compelling view of all your data Facebook now have.
