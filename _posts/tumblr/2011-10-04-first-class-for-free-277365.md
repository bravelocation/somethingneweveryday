I finally started reaping the benefits of my East Coast railway "frequent fliers" program with my first ever free first class train journey finally booked yesterday.

It’s been really hard to spend my already extensive collection of points, because the trains I need to travel on up and down to London are almost always unavailable. I’m going to the US in a few weeks time and will be flying back to London and not going directly home, so it was a good opportunity to book a “return” on my trip home a few days later even if I won’t actually use the free return :-(
