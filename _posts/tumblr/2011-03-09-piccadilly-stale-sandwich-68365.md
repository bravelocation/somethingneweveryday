Desperate times lead to desperate measures. I’d had a massively busy day and then spent a couple of hours in the pub before realising I hadn’t done anything new. And I was starving.

Solution was to do something new and a bit stupid, which was to get a sandwich from the newsagent/mini-shop in Piccadilly Circus tube station. It was a stale cheese and onion one, but I was so hungry I would have and did eat anything.

Probably the least interesting post so far - only probably because there is plenty of competition :-(
