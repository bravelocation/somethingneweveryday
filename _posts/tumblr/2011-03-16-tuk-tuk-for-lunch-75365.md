We were a bit bored of doing the same thing for lunch, so on Wednesday we decided to head out into Soho and go somewhere new.

We ended up at [Tuk Tuk](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/tuk-tuk-london) on Old Compton Street, a noodle bar that looked promising. I got some vegetarian noodles and Paul had some sort of duck-based food with some watery soup. It all looked nice, but actually my noodles were exceedingly dull and I don’t think Paul thought much of his food either.

I don’t think we’ll be going back.
