I’ve been doing some more playing about with the Facebook SDK, and yesterday I added login functionality to my website at http://www.bravelocation.com
I’m actually really impressed with the simplicity of Facebook’s architecture, and how easy they’ve made it to program their network. There are very few people I know who don’t have a Facebook account, so it makes it the natural choice any time having a social graph is useful. Obviously this is giving massive power and influence to Facebook, but this probably isn’t the right time for Brave Location to take them on.
It was trivially easy to use the JavaScript SDK with the Python SDK for the back end code so add a login button to the page header, and to show the user’s profile picture and name when they are signed in.
If you want to try it out, feel free - rest assured I don’t do anything with the account information - for now ;-)
P.S. You might also appreciate the much improved - and not half bad now - mobile friendly design
