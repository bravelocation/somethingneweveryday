I’ve been looking around for some new ideas for another phone app, and the other day I found out about Factual.com, which is a repository for all kinds of interesting and mostly location based data.
There are lots of interesting things there, including quite a lot of UK-based information which is very nice. I do have an idea for a (pretty dull) app based on what I’ve found, hopefully more about that in the next few weeks.
