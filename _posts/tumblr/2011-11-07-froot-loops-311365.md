Breakfast in the Bing cafeteria, and I was looking for a Cheerios-like cereal. Unfortunately the nearest thing I could see was something called Froot Loops, which I hadn’t had before.
They are the most artificial tasting thing I’ve ever had, despite the protestations of having healthy, natural flavours on the packaging. Very strange, and not particularly nice. Won’t be trying again.
