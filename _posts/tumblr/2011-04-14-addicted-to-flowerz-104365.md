As I stated in a post a few days ago I’ve been thinking about writing a game for my phone, but on the train home I realised I hadn’t actually played that many.
I was bored and a little frustrated by the tw*t with the Mac sitting opposite and invading my personal space so I thought I’d waste an hour or so trying out a few of the games in the marketplace. However the first one I tried was Flowerz and I haven’t been able to stop playing it since.
It’s a simple game where you plant flowers of different colors in squares and when you get 3+ of the same color in a line they disappear. There are lots of subtleties in what happens when they regenerate and it’s really addictive. Definitely recommended if you want to pass a few hours bored on a train.
