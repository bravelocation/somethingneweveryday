Earlier in the week it was looking like Andy Murray had a fair chance of at least making the final, so we thought we’d do something new and have a barbecue on Men’s Final day. Obviously he faltered at the semis once again, but the weather was good and food was ready so we went ahead anyway.
Following some tips from the excellent Planet Barbecue website, I think I got my best ever barbie going and the veggie sausages and burgers were very good, although my halloumi kebabs not so much.
The tennis was disappointing for most of us who were supporting Nadal, but much Pimms was enjoyed by all.
