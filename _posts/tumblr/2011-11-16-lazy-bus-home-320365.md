I was looking for something for me tea, so rather absentmindedly I went up to Tescos on Tottenham High Street, forgetting how crappy it is. It had been a long day, and by the time I left I decided to be very lazy and get the bus down the Seven Sisters Road back to the flat rather than the 15 minutes walk - first time I’ve done that.
With my dodgy knees I do try to walk the 10-15 minutes at each end of my journey every day as it does help a lot (not if I do much more) but it’s been a very busy couple of weeks away from home - which I’ll use as an excuse for my lazyness.
It’s the final weighing of my 14 week diet on Saturday, so we’ll see how a week in the US and a hectic work schedule has affected it.
