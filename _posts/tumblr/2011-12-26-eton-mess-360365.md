Boxing Day party, and instead of my usual Banoffee Pie I decided to do something new and made Eton Mess.

I followed another Delia recipe, and the only slightly complicated bit was making the meringues (which turned out pretty well). The rest was just pureed strawberries, lashings of cream and sliced bananas all over a bed of smashed up meringue pieces. Simple and lovely.
