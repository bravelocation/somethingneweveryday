Sounds a little grander than it was, but we had a nice social event on the outside balcony area at our office on Wednesday afternoon.

My Facebook friends will have already seen some of the pictures from the event, and in particular the exciting game of Jenga we had. I notionally lost after a ridiculously high tower toppled about 5 seconds after my turn was complete, but clearly it was the wind that blew it over :-)

Unfortunately I had to run off pretty early to get my train back home to the North, but it was a fun way to spend a few hours taking a break from work.
