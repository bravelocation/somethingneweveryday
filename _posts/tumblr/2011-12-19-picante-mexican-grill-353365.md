Finally, somewhere decent to eat near Victoria!
A few people in the office had mentioned Picante as a good place to go, but Monday was the first time I’d ventured there myself. It’s not that easy to find being in the middle of a pretty residential area, but well worth the trip as the burrito I had was excellent. Not quite Chipotle standard but close enough, and I will almost certainly be going back here at least once a week.
