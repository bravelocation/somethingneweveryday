Almost a flashback to the heady days of earlier in the year where I had “interesting” lunches in Soho.

We decided to try once again to find something interesting to eat in Victoria, and ended up in [Crussh](http://www.crussh.com/) on Strutton Street. I think I’ve been to the Soho branch in the past, but I definitely hadn’t tried the Watercress, Yuzu & Celeriac Healthpot before.

It was OK, and definitely better that the usual fare available around the office. Paul’s lamb stew thing looked better (except for the meat) so will definitely try there again as it was just about worth the 10 minute walk.
