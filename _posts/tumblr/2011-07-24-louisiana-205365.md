Louisiana (205/365)
Another very wet day in Copenhagen, so we took a train 30 minutes up the coast to go the Louisiana Modern Art Gallery in Humlebaek.
It was actually a fantastic place to visit, in particular 2 David Hockney pieces - a massive Grand Canyon picture which is the only thing Iâ€™ve ever seen which captures the enormity of the place, and a brilliant exhibition of his iPad/Phone drawings and a video of him actually making one. Very highly recommended.
