After playing about with some iPads at the Apple Store in Newcastle, I thought I’d investigate if it was possible to add swiping support to a web page to make some of the sites I manage better suited to a touch interface.

After a bit of Binging, I found out about jQuery Mobile which amongst other things does exactly what I was looking for.

Now I’m definitely no JavaScript expert, and I haven’t really played much with jQuery, but the mobile version was both new to me and looks quite useful.

Unfortunately my first attempts failed dismally as the code didn’t mesh well with another framework I was using, but I learnt a lot so it wasn’t a totally wasted hour or so.
