Hilary was on her way back from her walking holiday in Cornwall, so I thought I’d have a Cornish cream tea ready for her when she got home.

I’d not made scones before, and they turned out pretty well despite only finding a star-shaped pastry cutter which made for a non-traditional shape. With some butter, jam and clotted cream they were just what was needed after a 12 hour train journey the length of England.
