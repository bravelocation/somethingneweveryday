I wanted to tart up the http://www.somethingnew365.com/ website a bit but am reasonably happy with the Posterous theme I’m using right now (and can’t be bothered to invest the time tweaking the CSS). So what to do?
One thing that was slightly irritating me was the way the Facebook link to the post had a double picture of me, one for my Facebook account picture and one for the blog post which happens to be the same one, so I decided to make a new logo for the site profile.
However my design skills are weak, so I did my usual thing of finding a font I like, picking a color and I’m done. I do quite like the results though, and hope you do to - although the Facebook fix didn’t work :-(
I was now on a roll and also made a stunning new icon for Bedside Clock v2, but you’ll have to wait to see that one in all it’s glory until the release
