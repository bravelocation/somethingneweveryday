Turner Prize Finalists (294/365)It’s a big coup for the North East to get the Turner Prize exhibition at The Baltic, and yesterday was the first dayit was open to the public we went down to have a look.
It was full of TV crews and radio interviewers which we managed to avoid (although disappointed not to be in the background on the local TV news) and the finalists’ shows were interesting and thought-provoking - despite some of them being basically nonsense.
I’ve added my reviews on Twitter already so won’t repeat them here, but I’ll be very disappointed if George Shaw doesn’t win.
