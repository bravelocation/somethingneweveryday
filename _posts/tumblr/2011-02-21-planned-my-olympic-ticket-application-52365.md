I’m very excited about the Olympics coming to London in 2012, particularly now I have a room here to stay (assuming I can keep up my long distance commuting lifestyle for another year).
I’d got confused by the various ticket announcements, thinking that the ticket ballot was already open when it’s actually in a few weeks time. However the timetable for events has been released as well as the ticket prices, so last night I spent a fun couple of hours planning what I’d like to see.
I’d already gone through the sports with Hilary seeing what she’d like to see, and seeing if they matched any of my preferences. Luckily they’re not too far off, so I now have an “ideal” schedule worked out. It’s interesting with the ballot system in place, as it would be fantastic to see those events where we have a chance of winning a medal, but I’m sure those events will be over-subscribed. Tough choices!
I think I’ve optimised my application plan now, and am applying for tickets for:
Tennis
Table Tennis
Gymnastics
Weightlifting
Cycling
 Athletics
Diving
Handball
Basketball
I’d love to see the Athletics and Cycling, but not confident I’ll beat the rush. I love the Weightlifting so I’m hoping that’ll work out, and I have no idea about Handball but I’m assuming no one else does either, so I’ll definitely get to see one event!
What are your plans?
