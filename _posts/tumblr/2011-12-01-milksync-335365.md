One of the most productive things I’ve done this year was get a [pro subscription to Remember The Milk](/paid-for-pro-subscription-to-remember-the-mil/). I used to track my tasks solely in Outlook, but the flexibility of RTM makes it much better IMHO.

However, I still obviously use Outlook a lot, so I thought I’d check out [MilkSync](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/milksync/outlook/), a way of syncing the two systems up.

It seems to work fine, but one drawback is that all the “tasks” I’ve added into RTM are in Outlook, even those that aren’t really things to do but lists of ideas - which doesn’t really work so well. I’ll stick with it a while longer, but actually all it’s really proved is what I already knew - RTM > Outlook.
