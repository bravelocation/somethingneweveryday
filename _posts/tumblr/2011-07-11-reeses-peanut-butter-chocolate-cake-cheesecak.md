Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake (192/365)
In typical US style we’re continuing to stuff our faces on our trip.
On Monday we went to the Cheesecake factory in Bellevue for dinner, and although we all had big main course, we thought it would be rude if we didn’t have a piece of cheesecake for dessert. The portions are massive there, so we decided to share a piece of an amazing new flavour (for me) between the 4 of us - Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.
It was as rich as it sounds, and although it was really nice we were glad we’d shared a single slice between us all.
