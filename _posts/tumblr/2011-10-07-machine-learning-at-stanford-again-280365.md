If you’re following closely, I had a [similar post](/machine-learning-at-stanford-226365) to this back in August when I started looking at the online lectures on machine learning at Stanford.

Not long after I posted that, Stanford announced a [proper online course](http://www.ml-class.org/) with lectures, questions and help especially designed for the Internet, so I’ve switched to doing that instead. It’s actually really good, and my new thing was completing the first set of modules.

I’m not sure if they’ve closed entry yet, and I know many of you are also doing the same course, but if you do get a chance to get on the course it’s definitely recommended.
