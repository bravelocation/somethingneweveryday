My journey down to London every Monday involves an early morning connection at Newcastle, which I’ve got a reasonable 8 minutes to make. However for the first time yesterday I missed it for the rather pathetic reason that the signalman at Prudhoe had overslept so the Hexham train started off late :-(

Even though the incoming train was 10 minutes late, I still almost made it as I could see the London train on the next platform, but only after I’d sprinted halfway there did it start pulling out. Very frustrating. I had to get the next train which was a lot slower and so like a lot of other people got to work an hour later than usual just because of one man’s laziness. Very poor.
