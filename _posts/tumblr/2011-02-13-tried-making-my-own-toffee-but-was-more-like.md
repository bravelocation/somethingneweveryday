We were going to go to the pictures yesterday (ended up not going in the end) so I thought I’d be mildly rebellious and make and smuggle in my own sweets.
I had a fancy for some toffee, so had a go using a recipe I found at http://www.blagger.co.uk/recipes/toffee-recipe/. 
I clearly did something not quite right, as the toffee took ages to solidify and didn’t really harden up. You could scoop it up and just about roll it up into a sweet, but it was really caramel rather than toffee - although it tasted absolutely fantastic!
I’ll definitely try making it again as it was really easy, although I’ll try a different recipe next time
