Continuing my Spanish cooking theme, I decided to have a go at making churros - sort of Spanish doughnuts - and home made hot chocolate.

Hilary had done a 26 mile walk over the Northumberland hills, so I thought she’d deserve a treat when she got home. I used a recipe from the usually reliable Simon Rimmer’s cookbook, but the churros didn’t turn out perfectly. I think I made them a bit thick because I don’t have a piping bag, and they were OK but a bit sturdy. The hot chocolate, made from Green and Black’s dark chocolate, condensed and real milk was brilliant though.

Picture turned out badly, so I can’t share the ugliness of them with you.
