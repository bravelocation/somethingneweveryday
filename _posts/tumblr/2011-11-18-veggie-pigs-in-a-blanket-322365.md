I’ve always loved the name of “pigs in a blanket” for a type of food. In the UK that means sausages wrapped in bacon, but it turns out there are lots of other meanings [around the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigs_in_a_blanket). Who knew?

Obviously being a vegetarian has meant I can’t really have this delicacy, but I decided to make an innovative alternative version by wrapping some veggie sausages in some “false meat” ham - and them in a sandwich.

Quite nice without being particularly interesting, but there being no such thing as decent veggie bacon about the best I can do unfortunately.
