Enjoyed a fine night out after work in Munich on Monday. After going out for some typical Bavarian food in the City Centre (I had some mushroom soup with a dumpling in it), we headed over to [Hofbräuhaus](http://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/index_en.html), a famous drinking establishment and bit of a tourist trap.

It was a fun place for an hour or two, with a band in lederhosen playing drinking songs and some large glasses of fine German lager. Not sure I’d like to go every week, but definitely glad I went.
