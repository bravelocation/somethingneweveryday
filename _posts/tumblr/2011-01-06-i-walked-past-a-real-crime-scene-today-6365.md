I was walking down the famous (but I’m sure disappointing for tourists) Carnaby Street on the way to the office this morning and there was a proper crime scene - something I’ve never seen before.
A shop on the corner of one of the side streets was cordoned off with bonafide “Police Line” tape, and there was a man in a dust suit delicately brushing the outside of the shop for fingerprints. I didn’t see any evidence of a break-in or smashed windows, and to be honest I have no idea what might have happened.
I didn’t think it appropriate to take a photo, but it was quite exciting in a very-low key, CSI-style way.
