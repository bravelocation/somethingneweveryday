I was talking to Hilary about how electronic publishing will soon overtake paper-based books (we have this conversation a lot and you can guess which side each of us is on!), and afterwards I thought I’d actually learn how you can publish your own Kindle books.

It turns out it’s actually quite easy, and you can see all the details for yourself at [https://kdp.amazon.com](https://kdp.amazon.com). There are lots of standard formats (HTML, Word, PDFs etc.) that will work, but I suppose the art is making the book look reasonable on the slightly limited Kindle format.

What I’m thinking of doing is putting all the 365 days of this blog - assuming I make it to the end - in a free book on Kindle. If you’re reading this in that format, you must either be a very big fan (in which case you worry me) or you are me and I’m talking to myself. Hello.
