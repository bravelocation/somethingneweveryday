The commute back to Tottenham was an absolute nightmare on Wednesday. The Piccadilly line was jammed because of a broken down train, and it took 30 minutes to get from Piccadilly Circus to Russell Square, all the time stuck between armpits of two fellow sufferers.
Once we hadn’t moved for a while I decided to get out and walk up to Kings Cross from where I knew I could get the 259 back to right outside the flat, something I hadn’t done before.
Once I’d found the stop down the side of Kings Cross station, I only had to wait a couple of minutes and the route home was quite an interesting one, going past both Pentonville and Holloway prisons. Not sure I’ll do it again by choice, but at least I know what to try if (when) there is a tube strike.
