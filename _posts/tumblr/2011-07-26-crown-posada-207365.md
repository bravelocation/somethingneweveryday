In between vacation visits, but I went into Newcastle to meet Frank and Josie off the train, and while Josie was in [Opus](http://www.opus-art.com/gallery/) talking shop we went for a drink in Crown Posada, a nice little real ale pub a bit further down Dean Street.

Not much more to say really, other than it was a decent place to spend a couple of hours.
