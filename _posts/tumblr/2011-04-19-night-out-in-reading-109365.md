I was on a 2 day work thing in Reading, and it made sense we stayed over so a group of us headed out into the City Centre for dinner and a couple of drinks.
Iâ€™d not really seen anything much of Reading but we ended up by the canal near the Oracle Centre, which was pretty decent especially on a sunny evening. After a good meal at Giraffe some of us ended up in the Allied Arms before heading back to the delights of the Travelodge.
