A very long day, travelling down to London from home and then having some late meetings in the office. By the time I’d got back to the flat I couldn’t be bothered to try something new AND interesting (well to me anyway!) but I did have something in the bag already - but apologies for the poor quality.

As anyone who’s been commuting via Victoria recently knows, the underground is a complete nightmare as they rebuild large parts of it. Getting out from the Victoria line offers a variety of options all guaranteed to be quite slow, but I found an alternative that might well be the quickest. I went up towards the Circle line, but used the westbound platform instead of the eastbound one. Fewer people used that was as the National Rail sign pointed people towards the eastbound platform, so I probably saved - I don’t know - maybe 10 seconds. These things are important for London commuters!
