Back in London this week, but still keeping on with the phone development theme.
Mark pointed out to me that the upcoming version on Windows Phone (“Mango”) has a power detection API, so I updated my Bedside Clock phone app to tell the user if they’re not plugged in as they may want to do so. In the earlier version it did that always because I couldn’t detect if they were on power or not.
Now all I need to do is find the courage to update my phone with the beta bits to test it out :-)
