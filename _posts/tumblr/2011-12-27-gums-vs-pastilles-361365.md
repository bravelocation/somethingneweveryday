It’s the time of year for sitting in front of the TV and doing as little as possible, and I’ve been succeeding very well in doing that.
However I have to do something new, so I managed to do this without spending much effort yesterday in the following way.
I had a packet of what was called “pick and mix” sweets, but was actually just Fruit Gums, Fruit Pastilles and Tooti-Fruttis. First I separated the Tooti-Fruttis and “donated” them to Hilary, but I was happy as I like very much both Fruit Gums and Fruit Pastilles. They both have different techniques for savouring, but at one point I tried something extremely novel and had one of each at the same time.
I can report that this didn’t enhance the experience of either particularly, as it just tasted like having a gum and pastille at the same time. Still someone had to try it.
Just 4 days of the year left now, but I can assure you things will pick up for the last drips of 2011 :-)
