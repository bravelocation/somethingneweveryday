The BA Heathrow-Seatac flight was completely booked up, so for my week long work trip to Seattle I had to go with Air France from Newcastle via Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris.

It actually all worked out OK in the end, but as the scheduled transfer time in Paris was only an hour and a quarter I knew beforehand it could get stressful. The NCL-CDG flight was 15 minutes late and took forever to taxi to the farthest point of the airport, which resulted in long bus ride back to the terminal. The security queues were then pretty long and I would have been in danger of missing the CDG-SEA flight if it hadn’t been delayed slightly too. By the time I got through I rushed straight to the gate to join the back of the boarding queue with just a few minutes to spare. Phew.

Despite the website not showing it I did have a vegetarian meal booked, which was a pleasant surprise, and I watched 3 decent movies (Limitless, Paul, and Just Go With It) and if it wasn’t for the too short connection time I’d definitely think about going that way again.
