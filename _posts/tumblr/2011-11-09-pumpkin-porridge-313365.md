I decided to try some porridge for breakfast yesterday. I’ve not been a big fan before, but there was some pumpking flavoured stuff in the Bing Cafe that looked interesting and new so I gave it a go.
I think what I’d not done before in my porridge eating was add in any sugar or extra milk, and that actually made it quite nice. May experiment again today to see if it was the pumpkin flavour or the toppings I liked.
Other interesting fact was that Qi Lu, Microsoft’s Head of Online Services was getting some porridge at the same time as me and Mark, so we had a brief porridge related chat that was almost certainly more memorable for me than it was for him :-)
