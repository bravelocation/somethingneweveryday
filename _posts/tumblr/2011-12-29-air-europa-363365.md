Back to Valencia for New Year with Frank, Josie, Hilary, Mandy and Sarah, which will hopefully provide a good finale to the year.

We spent most of the day travelling, but for various reasons we came by a different route than I’ve done before - Newcastle->Paris->Valencia.

I could get to hate Charles De Gaulle Airport as it’s very big and seems to take ages to get anywhere.

We booked with Air France, but the 2nd leg was actually with Air Europa who I hadn’t travelled with before so I’ll call that out as the “official” new thing. They were OK, but was slightly disappointed the in-flight food and drink had to be paid for RyanAir style.

There was a beautiful sunset when we arrived in Valencia which I couldn’t do justice to on my camera phone so I won’t share here, and then we headed out for a nice evening of food and drink.
