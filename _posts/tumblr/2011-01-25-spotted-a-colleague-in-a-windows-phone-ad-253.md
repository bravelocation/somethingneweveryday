Falling a bit behind on posting mainly due to jet lag, but don’t worry - I have been doing something new.

Yesterday I was watching an online video ad for Windows Phone 7, and about half way through (@1:05) I saw the name of Emily Ogura. Now I work with someone of that name in Bellevue who helps us out loads when we’re in town - was it really her? I couldn’t be sure.

When I got into the office I asked Emily if it was her in the video and she said it was, although she didn’t know she was actually in the ad and it had been made public. After she’d watched it, she was really pleased to see the results and that I’d let her know about it. Good deed done!

The video is actually really good, but I’ll let you judge that for yourself.
