We’ve been struggling to find new places for lunch, and decided to try [Itsu](http://www.itsu.com/) for lunch.

This was a bad choice. All of the food the 4 of us had was disappointing, and my vegetarian sushi was awful. No taste, too many vegetables just jammed into some rice, and extremely tasteless wasabi.

After checking the menu just now, I’m glad I didn’t have the vegetable rice bowl or potsu becuase both of them have fish in them. What’s all that about?
Turns out Itsu comes from the Pret-a-Manger stable, and that style of food production might be OK for sandwiches, but for psuedo-Japanese food I’d strongly advised to go somewhere else if possible.

I miss Soho.
