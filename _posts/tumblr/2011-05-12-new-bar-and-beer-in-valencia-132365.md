I’m in Valencia for a few days staying with Frank and Josie, which sounds like an easy source of new things but as I’ve been here a few times before it still needs a little “work”.
As usual as soon as I got here we ended up having a few too many drinks in the fine collection of bars on the square just down from their apartment. One had only opened in the last year since I was last here, so was new to me. It was called (I think) “Jamon Sessions” and was pretty good. We had some beer from Zaragoza called Ambar which I also hadn’t had before, so a double novelty - which in my sad world always seems like a waste!
