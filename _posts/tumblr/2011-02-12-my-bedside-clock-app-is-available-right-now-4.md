After just a couple of days waiting, my Bedside Clock app got approved yesterday so is available for download from the Windows Phone 7 Marketplace. I don’t think the app is anything particularly of note, but it’s pretty cool to have a published app!

Windows Phone 7 users can download it using this link: [http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2670018c-c233-e011-854c-00237de2db9e](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2670018c-c233-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) or by searching for “Bedside Clock”

For everyone else, I’ve made a particularly average web page (it’s not well designed even for me) with details and screenshots at [http://www.bravelocation.com/bedsideclock](http://www.bravelocation.com/bedsideclock)

If you do give it a try, be sure to give feedback on the app in the Marketplace - good or bad :-)

The bad news is I don’t have a constant source of new things now it’s done. The good news is I can get on with something more interesting in my side projects.
