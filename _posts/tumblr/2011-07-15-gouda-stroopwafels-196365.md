As mentioned yesterday I had a couple of hours stopover in Amsterdam waiting for my flight home to Newcastle, so I thought I’d browse the airport shops for something Dutch (and new!)
What I decided on was getting some Gouda Stroopwafels, which according to their marketing can be called syrup waffles, treacle waffles or even caramel cookie waffles - the last of which seems the most accurate to me. Very nice they were too.
