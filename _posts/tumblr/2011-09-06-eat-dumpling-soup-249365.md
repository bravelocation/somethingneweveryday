A bit behind on my posts due to travel which will become clear soon, but on Tuesday we went to Eat for lunch and I tried for the first time their dumpling soup.
It started off well as the Gyoza dumplings were really tasty. However the problem was there weren’t many of them and underneath the soup was most filled up with bean sprouts and a few noodles.
Not as bad as some of the lunches I’ve had recently, but no great shakes either :-(
