Fell off the wagon slightly on Wednesday, and had a couple of pints after work with Dave, Paul and Blazej in the [Star Tavern](http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=4&itemid=287&task=View) in Belgravia.

The new thing was really going into Belgravia, a posh bit of London not that far from the office but not somewhere I’d been before - and for certain hadn’t been drinking there before.

The pub itself was pretty decent, quite quiet (for central London) and with a slightly mysterious roped off area where there was a guy who was the spitting image of Scottish PM Alex Salmond (it wasn’t him!)
