Fell off the wagon slightly on Wednesday, and had a couple of pints after work with Dave, Paul and Blazej in the Star Tavern in Belgravia.
The new thing was really going into Belgravia, a posh bit of London not that far from the office but not somewhere I’d been before - and for certain hadn’t been drinking there before.
The pub itself was pretty decent, quite quiet (for central London) and with a slightly mysterious roped off area where there was a guy who was the spitting image of Scottish PM Alex Salmond (it wasn’t him!)
