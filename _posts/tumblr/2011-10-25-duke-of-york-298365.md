A new pub for the first time in a while - the [Duke of York](http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/pub-food/duke-of-york-victoria/pid-C0622) near our office and Victoria Station. 

It’s a real old skool place, and not in a good way. It stinks of beer when you walk in, and the decor is like a pub from the 1980’s when I was a lad, with crappy leather seats and flock wallpaper. It was full of people going to see Billy Elliot in the theatre next door plus the usual commuter crowd when we went in after work.

Still missing working in Soho a lot :-(
