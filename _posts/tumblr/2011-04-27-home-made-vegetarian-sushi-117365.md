Home made Vegetarian Sushi (117/365)
I eat sushi (vegetarian obviously) reasonably often, but Iâ€™ve never made my own before.
Our local Tesco has all the stuff required in the specialist food section, including a bamboo rolling mat. There were precise instructions for doing the rice and it turned out pretty well (very sticky!). For filling I used, shittake mushrooms, chilli, garlic, spring onions and finiely chopped pepper.
As you can see from the photo the finished result definitely looked like proper sushi, and with some super-hot wasabi sauce they tasted OK too. Quite fiddly to do, but will definitely experiment with doing this again.
