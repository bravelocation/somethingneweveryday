We had broadband problems in the flat which scuppered my plans for something “more exciting”.

However I did do something new - Ben and Mandy are having the garden done and part of that is getting a new fence put up. I was helping them carry the pieces through the flat, but unfortunately we couldn’t fit them down the back stairs.

The only way we could sort it out was to take them through next door;s flat, which was a totally new and slightly bizarre experience - walking through a stranger’s house with a piece of garden fence!
