Pressing on with the [Stanford Machine Learning course](http://www.ml-class.org/), and this week’s exercise involved learning about a new bit of software for me - [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

It’s a really nice piece of software for doing numerical calculations, and I expect will be heavily used by the course as it has a nice way of doing matrix arithmetic. If only they’d had software like this when I was a lad…
