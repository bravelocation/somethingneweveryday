I’m still working on v3 of my Bedside Clock phone app, and in particular adding in a “Settings” page to manage the different options better.
Now the list of basic controls built into the phone is quite short, but yesterday I checked out the SIlverlight Toolkit, a set of additional controls developed by Microsoft to make it easier to make good looking apps.
The controls are pretty good - in particular the “Toggle Switch” control was very useful in having a nice way to turn options on and off in my app.
