Back in the day I used to run a supporters site for the mighty Halesowen Town - the remains of which live on at http://www.yeltzland.net. However after getting sick of the ridiculous amount of vitriol and moaning I stopped doing it a few years ago.
However we’ve had a replacement at http://www.yeltz.co.uk for a while now, but it’s been plagued by reliability problems mainly because it’s been hosted by a cheapskate and useless hosting company.
It went down again a week ago and they couldn’t recover anything worthwhile, so we decided to move everything to a new hosting company. As “technical adviser” I did the setup of the SMF forum software which I hadn’t done before. It was pretty straightforward in the end once I’d copied all the files across, and everything appears to be working well although we’ve lost all the old posts and member details.
Fingers crossed as I don’t want to ever have to do that again!
