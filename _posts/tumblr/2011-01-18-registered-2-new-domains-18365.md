Every so often I have an idea for some software that I think might write which will make my fame and fortune - and occasionally after a few days contemplation I still think they’re not too stupid or haven’t been done before.

However the next step often seems to be finding a suitable domain name that hasn’t already been taken. It’s really hard nowadays to find a decent name that’s not either in use or owned by a domain squatter.

Anyway after some intense searching on GoDaddy I managed to find a couple of names which just about match my ideas and aren’t too lame, so I took the plunge and bought them last night. I’m hoping that actually splashing out (a little!) real cash may force me to actually turn them into something real.

Obviously I’m not going to tell you what my top secret ideas are just yet, that would be far too much information ;-)
