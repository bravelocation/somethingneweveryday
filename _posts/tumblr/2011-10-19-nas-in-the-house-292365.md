Since I had to move my router out of my home office, it’s been a pain running my Windows Home Server as it only works with a wired connection. Therefore I decided to rejig things a bit, and bought a USB NAS adapter which means I can simply share an external hard disk and printer on the network without needing a server.
I bought a little box from Addonics, which works quite nicely. It was simple to setup, and all our connected PCs are now hooked up via it. The only drawback right now is the USB hard disk that holds our music and photos backup can’t be added to the Windows 7 libraries without being synced locally, but that’s probably a good thing as it’s never bad to have too many copies I guess.
