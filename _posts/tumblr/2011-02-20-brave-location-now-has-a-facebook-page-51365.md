I’ve been meaning to play about with the Facebook SDK for a while now without really knowing what to do - more out of interest finding out what you can do using it than than anything else.
Anyway as a “Hello, World” style beginning I decided to set up a Facebook Page for Brave Location, the name of my company I used when I was contracting and the web site I use for various bits of code and details about me.
The process was a little weird, and I think I don’t get a properly named page until I get something like 25 “fans” which will clearly take a very long time. Also you get a different experience as an owner than as a regular visitor, which makes it much harder to know what everyone else will see.
The page can be seen at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brave-Location/201436123205629 but don’t expect too much right now.
I do have some plans for some Facebook apps which may or may not be more interesting, but I’m sure I’ll be blogging here about them if I actually get around to it.
