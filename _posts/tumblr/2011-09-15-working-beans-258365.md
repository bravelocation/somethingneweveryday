After the previous day’s birthday celebrations, I really needed a decent breakfast. My diet says I should try to have a high protein start to the day, so for the first time I made n early trip down to the cafeteria in our newish office and had some scrambled eggs and baked beans (with a sneaky hash brown).

Like most of the food we get at work it was OK, nothing fantastic but at the low, low price of £1.50 it’s hard to complain too much.
