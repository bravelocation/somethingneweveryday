After much back and forth, I finally added the location feature to my phone app by integrating Yahoo! PlaceFinderÂ to convert the latitude and longitude into an address.
Like many of the Yahoo! developer services, this one is really nice to use, has great data coverage and generous usage limits. I just hope it stays in place for a while as Yahoo! seems to be going through a transformation towards being a media company.
One thing I should mention about SimpleGeo though is that after my mini-moan a few days ago they did reach out to me and left a comment on the blog. Fair play to them on doing that, and I do hope they can improve their international coverage.
