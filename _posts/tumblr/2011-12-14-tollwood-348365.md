Still in Munich, and yesterday we went to Tollwood, a winter festival held on the same grounds of the more famous Oktoberfest.
It was an interesting night out, as there were some massive marquees full of either fairly random food or slightly hippy-ish craft stalls. Unfortunately I couldn’t get a veggie version of the half-metre sausage the others had, but we had fun with more glühwein and lager, as well as a fantastically crazy stall selling some sort of dowsing rods for determining freshness of food.
Still really enjoying Munich!
