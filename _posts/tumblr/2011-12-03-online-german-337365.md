Still wasn’t well enough to venture out of the house yesterday, but I thought I’d prepare for my upcoming work trip to Germany by doing an [online beginners course in German](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/german/).

I did a year’s German at school many, many years ago, but really have forgotten all but the very basics, so it was interesting to do a refresher course for the first time. I’m not sure it will help massively when I go to Germany for the first time in a week or so, but hopefully I can do at least the basics of please, thank you, beer, etc.
