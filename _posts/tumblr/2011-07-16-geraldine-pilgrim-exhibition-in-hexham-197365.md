I was hoping my last new thing before my hols would be going to a new barber in Hexham, as a new one had opened up. However despite them having staff sitting about doing nothing they were “fully booked up” so I couldn’t go there, and with that attitude they won’t last long.
After getting it cut at my usual place, it was p*ssing down so I took refuge in the Queens Hall and spent a few minutes looking around an exhibition by Geraldine Pilgrim. The pictures were quite interesting although what may have been an installation - or was it actually covered by a sheet? - was underwhelming either way.
Onwards to an easy week of new things in Scandanavia!
