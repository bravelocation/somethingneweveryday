It’s been a mobile phone sort of week, and I’m well behind on my blogging, so I’m going to do a few entries in a row here so I don’t forget what I did.
Wednesday I was out again after work, but I knew my phone was ready to be updated - it had alerted me - so I had something new to do when I got home. Hurrah!
Most people have focused on the upcoming “copy and paste” functionality but I can’t say I’v really felt missing out because I don’t have it. However there are the occasional glitches that it would be good to get fixed.
However, it turns out the update was just the pre-update update that updates the update service. That’s a lot of update for no real change :-(
Supposedly the real update will be following soon, but 3 days later there is no sign of it yet. All very disappointing.
