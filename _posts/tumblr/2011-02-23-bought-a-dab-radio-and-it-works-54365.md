I’ve been listening to the radio a lot more in my new flat, and realised the other day I could take advantage of not living in the middle of nowhere and upgrade to a DAB radio. 
We have a big old DAB radio at home that we bought when we lived in Brighton, but since we’ve moved to Northumberland such technological marvels don’t actually pick up any digital signals. I thought about bringing it down to London, but with space at a premium in my room I decided to get a new smaller model.
I didn’t want to spend a lot of money, so I went for a Pure One Mi which was just £34.95 from John Lewis (so I’m sure you can get it cheaper online).
The reception and sound is pretty good for a small radio, and I’m reasonably happy with it so far. One downside is it uses a custom battery pack which isn’t included if you want to use off the mains (which I probably don’t)
I was a bit concerned when it didn’t find Five Live Sports Extra when doing the autotune to find the stations, but according to this FAQ I need to rescan when there is a show being broadcast. Phew.
