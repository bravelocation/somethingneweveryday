Boat Trip around Stockholm Archipelago (201/365)
We were hoping to take a boat trip to Birka on Lake Maleren (the lake that connects to Baltic at Stockholm) to see an ancient Viking settlement, but the trip was over subscribed :-(
However instead we went on a relaxing 2 hour cruise around the 1000â€™s of islands that stand between Stockholm and the open water. The weather here has been fantastic the last 2 days (26C==79F) so it was nice to get out of the heat for a while and enjoy the fantastic scenery here.
