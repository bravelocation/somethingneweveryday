Another rainy day in Copenhagen, and after doing an epic bus tour around the town to keep dry we ventured off to find some lunch. We found a nice cafe in Christianshavn where I had something completely new - a vegetarian smörgåsbord.
This consisted on one plate:
Scrambled eggs
Pancakes
Fruit (Melon, Pineapple, Grapefruit)
Cheese and Spinach Pie
Hummus on Crispbread
Salad
Cheese and Jam
Yogurt and Fruit
Rye Bread
All pretty nice, and definitely an interesting concept in bringing it out together on one plate!
