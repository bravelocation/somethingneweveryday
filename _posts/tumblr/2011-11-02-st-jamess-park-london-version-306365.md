After wandering down Victoria Street from work looking for some food for me dinner, I realised I was quite near St. James’s Park tube station. So feeling a little lazy and needing to do something new, I decided to go into the station and get the tube back to Victoria before heading back to the flat.

I’d walked past the station many times before when I used to walk up to Soho from Pimlico, but had never caught the train there before. Being on the Circle and District lines isn’t generally much help to me, and it was surprisingly a lot busier than the Victoria or Piccadilly lines that time of night.
