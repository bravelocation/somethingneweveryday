This week’s culinary disaster was making my own Swiss Roll - something new in the kitchen for me. Even though I enjoy it, my baking skills are weak.
Disaster is probably too strong a word, but the trouble is the cake part came out a little heavy. This made it very hard to roll up after I’d added the jam and cream, so the “roll” turned out more of a “fold”.
I forgot to take a picture of the creation just after cooking, and as it actually tastes OK we’ve already hacked lumps out of it.
This is the recipe I nominally followed if you want to have a go yourself.
