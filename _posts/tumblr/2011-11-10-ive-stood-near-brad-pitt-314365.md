Most misleading post title of the year I’m afraid.
It’s been an insanely busy week at Bing HQ in Bellevue, so haven’t had chance to do much other than work and eat. However we went to the cinema on Thursday evening, and went to see Moneyball, which was a pretty good way of dramatising the excellent book.
The most memorable part for me was when Brad Pitt was at Fenway Park, and at one point he stood exactly next to where I sat once for a Red Sox game. About 4 years apart, but in a temporal sense I can now say I’ve stood in the same place as him, which I couldn’t have done before.
