I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything like this on a website before. I definitely recommend checking out the online graphing calculator by Desmos.
It’s surprisingly good fun to play about with the the sample equations to get some different graphs (honestly!), and some of the examples are just beautiful - for example see http://bit.ly/jtMxyq and then try playing with the variables.
Or is it just me?
