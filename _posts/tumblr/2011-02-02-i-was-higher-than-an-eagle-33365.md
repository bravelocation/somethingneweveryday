Not really the new thing, but I couldn’t resist that as a title.

As I’ve mentioned a couple of times this week, the views from the top of Bing HQ have been fantastic this week. As we were having breakfast early in the morning in the cafeteria on the 25th floor, Mark pointed out soaring below us was a Bald Eagle.

I’d never seen one before and it was impressively large with a massive wingspan. Really cool to see it with the sun rising up behind it over the Cascade Mountains.

I’m looking forward to heading home tomorrow, but will definitely miss the scenery here.
