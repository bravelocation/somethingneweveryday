I’ve more or less completely switched over to getting the train up and down to London every week, so I was very pleased when I had the chance to join my first ever train loyalty points program from East Coast Rail.
It’s surprisingly generous, in that if you spend £500 you get a free first class return. Now for me that’s basically one free return for every 4 trips, which will be great - especially because you get free breakfast in first class. Hurrah!
