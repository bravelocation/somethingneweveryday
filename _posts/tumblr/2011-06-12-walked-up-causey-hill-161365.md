My mom and dad are staying in Hexham next week, so we thought we’d go and see the cottage they’re staying in. What this meant was walking up the steep Causey Hill in Hexham, which was a first for me.
It’s a pretty steep walk up, and the day after my legs are a little stiff. Luckily we didn’t walk right up to Hexham Racecourse at the top, but it took a good 10 minutes longer to walk up than the walk back down. We’ll definitely be driving up when they are staying!
