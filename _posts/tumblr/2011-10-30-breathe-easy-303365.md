Both Hilary and myself were a little bunged up, and she has some of those “Robbie Fowler style” strips that you can put on your nose to help you breathe more easily. I’d never tried them before so I thought I’d give it a go.
I was surprised how well they worked, and definitely made it easier to breathe as the name suggests. However it was a bit irritating after a while, so after about 30 minutes I gave up and went back to normal.
It was a slow day.
