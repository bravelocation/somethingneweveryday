Yesterday was Valentines Day, but being away from home as usual meant I couldn’t do anything with Hilary (we went out for a lovely Chinese meal at [Artisam](http://www.kevinliu.co.uk/artisam-corbridge/) in Corbridge on Saturday instead).

Mandy had promised me an evening of pub quiz excitement at the [Daniel Defoe pub](http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/daniel-defoe-review-55249.html) in Stoke Newington, but when we got there they’d cancelled it because they didn’t think anyone would want to do a quiz on Valentines Day. They were wrong.

In any case I had a nice night getting to know potential future team-mates over a couple of beers, so not all was lost.

Stoke Newington seemed even more upmarket than the last time I was there a few years back, although I think I recognized a few places on the walk down.
