Another day in Valencia, and after a very long lie-in we headed down to the beach for tortilla bocadillo - easily the greatest hangover food known to man - and then came back to try to find somewhere we could watch the Cup Final.
I’ve definitely never watched the Cup Final in Spain before, and we ended up in “La Salamandra” (spelling is now 100% correct!), a bar I’ve walked past many times but not been in either. It was a disappointing game (as usual), but the bar was an excellent choice.
