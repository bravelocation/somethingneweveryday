Stella Black (165/365)
We headed back to The Glassblower on Tuesday after work, and I tried a pint of Stella Artois Black for the first time.
Now it wasn’t black, didn’t taste very nice and I felt like sh*t the next day like normal after drinking Stella.
The things I have to do to entertain you dear readers.
