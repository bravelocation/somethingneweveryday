Not a very exciting first today. Still dieting - and making everyone else’s life a misery because of it - but for lunch on Tuesday I went to Eat for a sandwich and had a cheese and “real ale” pickle one. The 2nd part was definitely a first for me, but to be honest it just tasted of regukar pickle to me.
Said it wasn’t exciting, but I like the title :-)
