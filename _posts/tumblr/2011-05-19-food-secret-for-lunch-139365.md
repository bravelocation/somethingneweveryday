We went to Food Secret for lunch on Thursday - and it must be the most confusing place ever.
It was very strange to be asked when you walk in whether you’d been before; how hard can it be to pick up some soup or a sandwich?It turns out very hard as they somehow will either make you something slightly off menu, or adapt one of off the shelf items. I think, I still don’t quite get it.
I saw a Goat’s Cheese and Spinch Wrap which looked OK and finally figured out I could just pay for it!
The food was actually delicious, but I don’t think I could go through the stress of going back.
