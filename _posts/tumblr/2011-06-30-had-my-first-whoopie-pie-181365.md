Last day working in Soho (moving offices to Victoria next week) so on the way to work I thought I’d go to Starbucks on Piccadilly for a change. I’ve been there before, but was looking for something unhealthy after being on the booze the night before and saw they had a chocolate whoopie pie on offer.
I’ve not tried one before and it was quite nice, a slightly strange mixture of biscuit and cake with a creamy filling. Could also be that Starbucks isn’t the best supplier too so I need to try more!
