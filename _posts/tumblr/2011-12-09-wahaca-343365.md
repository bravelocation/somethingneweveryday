Another day shopping and eating our way around London, and the best of a selection of new things was going to Wahaca for lunch, the reasonably famous Mexican restaurant on Wardour Street.
Not sure how Iâ€™ve managed not to go here before when I used to work around the corner, but the food was very good. An interesting selection of slightly different Mexican dishes and a good set of veggie options too. Only slight disappointment was the Horchata, which it turns out is quite different to the Valencian variety I was used to and expected.
It was really nice spending some time enjoying London more as a tourist than in the usual commuter mode - it really is a fantastic place.
