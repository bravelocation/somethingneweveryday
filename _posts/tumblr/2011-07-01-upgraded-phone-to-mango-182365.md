After playing about with the dev tools this week, I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my actual handset to the new Mango release of Windows Phone 7.
I was slightly concerned because Mark had gone first and it hadn’t worked for him - it didn’t brick his phone and we think it’s a 64 bit Windows issue - but I gave it a go anyway and although it took a couple of hours it installed fine.
The new OS isn’t obviously different, but after a couple of days use there are lots of small usability touches that are really nice. It’s so much nicer to use (and develop for) than my old Android phone already, and this upgrade helps extend that gap even more. Definitely a contender, but how well it does in the marketplace will have to be seen.
