Last day of our short trip to Wroclaw, and we were finishing up in the office before heading to the airport for a very late flight home. I was looking for something to drink, and their fridge was full of interesting things to try.

I decided on a bottle of Lemon Iced Tea from Nestea, which I hadn’t tried before - and it was surprisingly nice.

I’d had Iced Tea before back in the day when I worked on kids summer camp in the US when I was a student, but that was always from jugs of basically crap that the kids had at lunchtime. This stuff was much nicer, and I’d definitely have it again if I saw it back home.
