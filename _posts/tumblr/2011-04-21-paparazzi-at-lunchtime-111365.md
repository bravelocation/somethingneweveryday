I was heading out for lunch and on Brewer Street I saw something new - a paparazzi running around taking shots of a celebrity (or two?) on the other side of the road.
It was really hard to see who it was without being totally uncool and running over ourselves, so neither myself or Ross really identified the mystery person(s). Some desperate research to uncover celebrities who were currently in London, and our (well my) best guess was Jennifer Garner who was at the premiere of Arthur.
However when writing this post I’ve figured out who it was - “So You Think You Can Dance” is on the TV (after Hilary’s favorite Dr. Who) and it’s presented by Cat Deeley, who has exactly the same hair and look as our mystery celebrity. I’m 90% sure of it :-)
