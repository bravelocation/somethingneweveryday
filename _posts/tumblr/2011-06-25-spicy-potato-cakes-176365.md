More Spanish cooking from my [Little Book of Tapas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Tapas-Book-Murdoch-Books/dp/1742660304/), this time making some spicy potato cakes.

I must admit I don’t think I’ve ever had them when in Spain, but they turned out pretty well, and with some roasted peppers and shallots made a tasty summer meal.
