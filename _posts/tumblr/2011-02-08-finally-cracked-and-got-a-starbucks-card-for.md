I probably go to Starbucks on the way to work more than I think I do, and yesterday I finally admitted that to myself and got a Starbucks reward card.
My new commute means I have about 30 minutes to read The Times on the way in, so rather than sit and read the sports news whilst having my coffee I decided to do a bit of work. Getting the Starbucks card seems a reasonable trade-off for getting free Wi-fi and according to their website I also get free stuff if I use it to pay. Obviously they’re getting data on my particularly dull shopping habits and the interest on my outstanding balance (a few quid), but that’s fine with me I guess.
My name is John, and I am a Starbucks user.
