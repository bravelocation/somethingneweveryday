Still doing indoor new things as still under the very poor Northern weather, but was slightly cheered up when I discovered the brilliant website [http://planefinder.net/](http://planefinder.net/) which I hadn’t heard of before.

Basically it has real-time tracking of airline flights, which means in a planespotter sort of way you can figure out exactly what plane is flying overhead.
For example, as I write this a day later I can hear a plane flying over the flat in Tottenham, which I now know is an Aegean Airlines flight from Athens to Heathrow. Fascinating!

If you find any of that remotely interesting, you’ll definitely love this website. If not, it’s still worth a quick look I promise.
