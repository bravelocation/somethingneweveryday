The day was really overshadowed by the terrorist attacks in Norway. Here in Copenhagen there are quite a few Norwegians around who were obviously worried about people at home - I was talking to one guy and his family in a bar who was desparately trying to contact people at home to check they were all OK. We were in Oslo a couple of years ago and had a great time with very friendly people - a very sad day.
We had a reasonable time doing touristy things around Copenhagen. The best was probably going up the “Round Tower”, an old building that used to hold the University library. It has a ramp inside going up 5 floors that is bizarrely remeiniscent of going up the Mestalla football stadium in Valencia.
The rain finally stopped in the evening, so with all the other tourists we headed down to Nyhavn to sit in the sun with a couple of drinks.
