After a pretty successful but short work trip, I flew back home on Thursday night so I could get back for my holiday starting on Sunday. However just like on the way out we couldn’t get our usual BA flight via Heathrow so for the first time I flew back with Delta to Newcastle via Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam.

I’d managed to upgrade to a seat with more leg room for just £74 so I did manage to get a decent amount of sleep. However the food was very poor (dry macaroni cheese) and there was no individual movie screens. Definitely more room than on BA so fine on the way home when you need some sleep, but everything else on Delta is just a little worse.
