As I’ve [mentioned before](/betting-syndicate-actually-won-some-money-163) we have a betting syndicate at work where we are trying to predict the football scores using our nerdy skills.

Our predictions were working great to begin with, but we’ve been “unlucky” recently and have been on a terrible run of results. I’ve always been a traditional bookmaker sort of gambler, with Ladbrokes being my favorite for no particular reason, but we’ve been looking into using BetFair instead.

At BetFair you can either bet or lay odds, which generally means the margins are more generous. Anyway I’d never used the site because to be honest it was always a bit complicated to figure what to do, but for research purposes I’ve opened an account and made some investments.

If you’re interested, the matches where we think the odds are in our favour this weekend are:

* Blackpool to beat Spurs
* Stoke to beat Arsenal
* Man. United to beat Chelsea

Obviously the first 2 are pretty long odds so unlikely to come up, but we think the odds are better than are offered. We will see :-)
