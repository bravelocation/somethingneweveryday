I’ve been playing about with making some video slideshows from still pictures - mainly tinkering around with Josie’s “a photo every hour” series talked about on her blog (or see the pictures on her Facebook page).
I’ve done similar things before, mainly my epic movies of our 2005 US Jolly Boys holiday (here, here and here if you want to relive their glories), but I hadn’t tried using Windows Live MovieMaker 2011 before, which was a big improvement on earlier versions.
The new movie is still under wraps as it’s still work in progress, but it was so much easier to use, and a great tool for free.
