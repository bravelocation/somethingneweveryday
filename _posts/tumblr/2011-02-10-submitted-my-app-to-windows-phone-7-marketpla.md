Been another painful travel day with absolute chaos at Kings Cross following signal failure. I’m already over an hour late and it’s touch and go if I’ll make the last train back to Hexham. What a crappy week :-(

Anyway, the good news is I’ve used the time reasonably productively and finally gone through all the steps to submit my Bedside Clock app to the Windows Phone 7 Marketplace.

It really isn’t much of an application, but it will be nice to actually get something there to show off a bit. Hopefully it will get through the testing phase OK - my only worry is that the testers might moan of power usage as the clock stays on all night (sort of the point of it). There are other similar apps that have been approved so hopefully it’ll be there soon.

I’ll definitely post again once it’s available for download, as that will be an exciting new experience for us all.

I’m glad I got this done, as my alternative new thing was trying a veggie patty at Subway for lunch. It was OK, but would definitely be the lamest so far by a long way.
