Winter finally arrived at home in Hexham with some heavy snow showers, so it wasn’t really a day for venturing out. Therefore I thought stay indoors and checked out the ["Cool Tools" app](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/apps/a1059a9f-ad34-451d-a275-562fb2eb189d) for Windows Phone 7.

It’s a really nice collection of small but useful things such as a stopwatch, ruler, flashlight, ...

Really well done, and definitely something I’d recommend for anyone with a Windows Phone.
