The final piece of my over-speced phone app v2.0 is now in place - I have a phase of the moon icon in the top corner when it’s nighttime. Another fantastically useful piece of functionality.
It was actually pretty easy to do once I’d found the algorithm online, and as ever the hard bit for me was doing the graphics. And who knew a nearly full moon was called a gibbous moon??
Just doing some final testing of the app on the train home, so just about ready to release the update. Should be done sometime in the extended holidays I hope.
