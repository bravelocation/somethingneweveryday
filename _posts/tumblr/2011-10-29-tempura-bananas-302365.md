More banana based food, but a little more sophisticated than [the day before](/banana-and-pickle-sandwich-301365).

I was looking for something Halloween themed to cook, but happened upon a recipe on the BBC site for [Tempura Bananas](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/tempurabananaswithwh_86294).

I’m not entirely sure about the measurements they gave as the batter was very thin, and in the pan they didn’t look great, but they tasted delicious with some whipped double cream and melted Green and Blacks butterscotch chocolate.
