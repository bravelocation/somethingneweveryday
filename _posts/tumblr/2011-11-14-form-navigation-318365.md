I haven’t done much mobile phone development recently, but I’ve been looking at the reviews for my Bedside Clock application, and decided to make some improvements.
What I wanted to do was add a separate settings screen, but I didn’t know how you’re supposed to switch between forms. So yesterday I learnt something new, and found out about the built-in Navigation service, which treats XAML pages as URLs and then you can switch between them.
Simple enough, and meant I could make decent progress on Bedside Clock v3.
