After my mini-rant the day before about crap lunch opportunities in Victoria, yesterday was a rare treat as there was an outdoor Xmas Market just outside the office in Cardinal Place, where one of the stalls was serving Empanadas, a delicious new food I hadnâ€™t even heard of before.
The stall said they were the Argentinian variety of Empanada, and as Wikipedia describes they are a sort of cross between a samosa and a pasty. I had 3 mozzarella, tomato and basil ones (they were quite small) and they were absolutely delicious.
If only the market was there every day :-(
