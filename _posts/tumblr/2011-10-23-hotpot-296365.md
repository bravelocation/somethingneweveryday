Hotpot (296/365)In honor of the passing of Betty from Coronation Street - and the nights drawing in - I decided to make a veggie Lancashire Hotpot on Sunday.
Iâ€™d never done one before, but it was very easy. Basically brown up some onions and Quorn pieces, put them in a cassorole dish with vegetable and stock, cover with thinly sliced potatoes and leave in the oven for a couple of hours on a low heat until done.
It was really nice, and will definitely do again.
