Continuing on our quest to go to every lunch place in Soho before it’s too late, on Vijay’s suggestion we went to Bodean’s BBQ Restaurant.
It’s a real meat-eaters place, and the burgers were massive. Me and Vijay had double-stacked veggie burgers and chips, which left us very full all afternoon. If you’re in the mood for a big, unhealthy but tasty lunch, this is defnitely the place for you.
