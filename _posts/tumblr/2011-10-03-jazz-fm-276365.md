Like a few posts ago, it had been a long day at work with the added pain of a delayed commute down to London. I only had a couple of very poor new things in the bag, so I once again turned to my digital radio and decided to give Jazz FM a listen.
Now I don’t really like jazz - from the little I know all that self-indulgent twiddling is a bit irritating - and an hour’s listening hasn’t changed that opinion at all. However as background listening as I read my Kindle it was OK I suppose, but very doubtful it’ll be an experiment I’ll be repeating.
