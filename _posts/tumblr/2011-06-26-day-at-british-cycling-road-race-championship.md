The British Cycling Road Race Championships were being held in the countryside not far from where we live in Northumberland, and being the first nice weekend day for a while we decided to go and watch.
We headed to Stamfordham, the small village where the start/finish line was, and joined a few thousand people there to watch the races. We just missed the finish of the women’s race but walked right past Olympic silver medallist Emma Pooley. We them mooched around the village while waiting for the men’s race to start, admiring the Sky team’s bus, and being very close to both Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish.
The race was 7 laps around local roads, leaving 45-50 minutes between sightings of the peloton. There was some great commentary/chat from Dave Harmon, the Eurosport commentator which helped pass the time (as well as the glorious sunshine). Team Sky had a massively powerful team and decimated everyone pretty early on leaving 3 of their riders well clear. We came home before the end, but Bradley Wiggins won from teammates Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh.
A great summer’s day out.
