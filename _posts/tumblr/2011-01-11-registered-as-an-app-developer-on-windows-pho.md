I’ve been playing around writing an app for my Windows Phone 7, and have finally got something that’s close to being good enough to post on the app store.
The one thing I really miss about my Nexus One Android phone is the way the alarm clock automatically came up when the phone was in it’s docking station. Out of habit I like to know the time when I wake up in the middle of the night, so I want a clock that’s always on at a low light.

My simple app isn’t very sophisticated, but is a simple clock that stays on all the time i.e. doesn’t go off at any time, and can be faded down to a low light.
It’s not available yet for your use, but now that I’ve registered as a developer I can now test it on my phone to see if it actually works properly :-)
