I’m getting very behind on my blogging, so for those of you watching live, I’ll explain why in a couple of “days” time very soon.

Anyway, on Wednesday a few of us went to the [Gold Class Cinema](http://goldclasscinemas.com/Theaters/Redmond-Washington.htm) in Redmond Town Center to watch True Grit, the new Coen Brothers movie.

The great thing about this cinema is that’s a real premium experience including:

* Individual reclining chairs
* Waiter service directly to your seat (drinks, snacks etc.)

Despite the extra price ($27 == £17), is probably was worth it, as it was so much better than the usual cinema experience. The only slight drawback was that I was so tired through jetlag that I did find myself falling asleep a couple of times.

As for True Grit, is was pretty good. However I think I was expecting too much just because it was a Coen Brothers movie, so was slightly disappointed. Still recommended though.
