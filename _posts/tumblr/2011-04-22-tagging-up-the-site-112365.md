Day 112 and I’m starting to forget what I’ve already done - which is obviously a problem if you’re trying to do something new each day.

Apart from the hand-built index page, there is a search on Posterous but it isn’t the greatest of features. I wanted to do some cooking tomorrow (stay tuned) and wasn’t 100% sure I hadn’t made the thing I was planning before.

Now it turns out I hadn’t, but to help the discovery process I spent a fun couple of hours doing something new and going through the site and adding tags to each post to categorize them.

I didn’t realize Posterous had this facility, and in their usual efficient way you can even do it via the original email. I’ve attempted to do that here so hopefully you can find all of these rather self-reverential posts about blogging.
