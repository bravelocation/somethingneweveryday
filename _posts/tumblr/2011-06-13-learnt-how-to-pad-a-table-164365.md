I was joining a few jobs on Josie’s website and realised my spacing of a couple of images on the homepage was a bit off in IE9.
Now I’m no HTML or CSS expert, so I fell back onto my tried and trusted <table> tags to align the images. However I couldn’t figure out how best to set the padding and spacing between the cells, but after a bit of searching I learnt about padding styles on cells by using padding-right and the like.
I’m sure there must be better ways of doing it, but I learnt something new and the page looks OK, so I’m happy!
