After noticing Twitter had released code to add a "follow" button to your website, I thought that would be a good thing to learn about on the train home.
Turned out it was easy enough, and it didn’t take long to to get one up and running on my Brave Location site.
Actually I’m getting a little sick of social networking buttons taking over every website at the moment, but I’ll leave that rant for another day.
