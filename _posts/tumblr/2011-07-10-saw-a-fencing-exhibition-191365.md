It was Paul’s first time in Seattle (in the US even) so we decided to do the tourist spots. After pancakes at IHOP and a brief tour of the Microsoft campus, we headed downtown on the bus, and ended up going to the Seattle Center on the monorail. 
We didn’t fancy risking going up the always rickety looking Space Needle, so we went for a wander around and found there was a Bastille Day French festival going on (a few days early!) For unknown reasons this involved amongst more traditionally French things a display of fencing - the sport not the gardening type.
I’d never seen real fencing before and it was quite interesting, especially when the experts came on and gave a great display of very fast action. Glad I didn’t go for Olympic tickets though, as other than by watching the electronic scoring system it was very hard to tell what the hell was going on.
