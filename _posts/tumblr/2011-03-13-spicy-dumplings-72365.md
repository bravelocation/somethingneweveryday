With the weather still not very Spring-like, on Sunday I thought I’d cook something warming, and made a chilli stew with a new thing for me - dumplings.
They were much easier to make than I thought, just flour, butter, a little milk some freestyle spices I added for kicks. It was hard to tell when they were done in the slow-cooked stew, but I guessed at 20 minutes and they came out perfectly. A rare culinary triumph!
Even my presentation wasn’t bad, as you can see from the before and after pictures.
