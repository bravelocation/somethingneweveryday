I think it’s pretty fair to say I’m not really a gardener, but yesterday we were having our big pre-winter cleanup.
In the front garden we have three big bushes/trees which were getting very large and were growing far too far onto the pavement. However this needed specialist equipment so Hilary’s brother David got a chainsaw and attacked that.
I got to do some pruning on the bushes that were overgrowing in a similar but reduced way over the front side fence. Never done this before, but it was quite theraputic using a massive pair of shears (about two foot long) to chop stuff out the way. Maybe have another go in 2 years time :-)
