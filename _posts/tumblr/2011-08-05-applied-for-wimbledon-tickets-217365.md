After the disappointment of the Olympic ballot - where we didn’t get any tennis tickets - we thought we’d have a go at entering the ballot for tickets for Wimbledon proper next year.
It’s a fairly convoluted process, but stage one is now completed so we’ll see what happens. No idea what the odds of getting something are, but surely better than the Olympics???
