I fancied some pasta for me tea, and on a quick trip down to Tescos in Hexham I found some that I hadn’t tried before called Trofie.
According to the page I linked to above, it’s a Ligurian speciality, and despite looking slightly weird (a bit like pasta twiglets) it tasted really nice with an Arriabiata sauce. Will definitely try again as I have half a bag left :-)
