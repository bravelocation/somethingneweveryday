Monday was our first day working in the main Microsoft building in Cardinal Place near Victoria Station. I’ve been in the building many times before, but it was very strange to think we’ll be working their full-time from now on rather than in lovely Soho.

The office itself is actually much better, but the location clearly isn’t anywhere near as good. The tube at Victoria is bad at the best of times, and with all the work going on there right now it’s an absolute nightmare.

For the blog I get some easy new things this week, but on the downside it’s going to much harder to get new (and interesting!) lunches. Ho hum.
