Pre-Xmas family gathering on Saturday, so I thought I’d cook something. My mom has got a really old Mrs. Beeton’s cookbook, and flicking through that I found a recipe for Treacle Tart.

It was really easy to make, and I added in a few secret ingredients which didn’t seem to make much difference. It started to overflow a bit in the oven which made it look a bit poor, but it tasted pretty good all things considered.
