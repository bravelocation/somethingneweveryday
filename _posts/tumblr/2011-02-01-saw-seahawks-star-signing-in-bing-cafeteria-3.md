Quite a strange first today.

I was working in Bing HQ in Bellevue, WA when there was a mini-commotion in the corridor. All we heard was someone say “you should get their autograph” which was enough to get us to investigate further. We went up to the cafeteria on the 26th floor - from which there were absolutely spectacular views today - and looked around, but didn’t spot anyone famous.

We almost gave up, assuming we’d misheard, but then we saw our colleague [Emily](/spotted-a-colleague-in-a-windows-phone-ad-253) rushing up to someone sitting down, and getting a poster signed. We still didn’t know who it was so didn’t want to risk approaching the “celebrity” and embarrassing ourselves.

Still at least we could ask Emily who he was and what was going on. Now it turns out it was Seattle Seahawks Cornerback Roy Lewis, who was in the building just to sign autographs.

Now here’s the bizarre bit. He was there just as part of an internal “Superbowl” promotion, which is basically some mashed potato with toppings in a bowl obviously linked to this weekend’s big game. I’d had some earlier in the week and it was OK, but getting in a sports star to promote it? That’s crazy. Microsoft really is a little weird sometimes :-)
