I finally updated my Bedside Clock app (again) and I’m hoping it will pass the vigorous Marketplace testing, so I thought it was a good time to play with the new development tools for the upcoming “Mango” release.
The new APIs look interesting, but with the phones not being updated for a while it’s a little bit of a mute point right now. However, the emulator upgrade looks good, especially being able to use the accelerometer and location.
