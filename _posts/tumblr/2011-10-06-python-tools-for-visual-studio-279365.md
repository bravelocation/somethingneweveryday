I’ve been doing more and more Python programming, both at work and at home, so it was good to learn about some nice Python Tools for Visual Studio, that I tried out for the first time on Thursday.
I haven’t had time to use them much yet, but it’s nice to be able to use a lot of the familiar functionality of Visual Studio when hacking away in what for me is still a reasonably unfamiliar language.
