I’m in Munich this week for work - which will really help the blog! In fact it’s my first ever trip to Germany too.
I’m a day behind in writing these words, and have had a great time here so far. Munich is a beautiful city, and we’ve enjoyed some fine hospitality. I’ll save some of the details for later posts, but on our first night here, following a pretty rapid taxi ride down the Autobahn (and past the Allianz Arena) we went out for a few (large) beers and I had some interesting dumplings.
