I am not a big car fan nor have I played one on the Internet.

The inside of my car has gradually been getting more and more filthy as we’ve been moving stuff to the tip, so I decided to pay some professionals to clean the inside and took it down the car washers in Tesco car park to get a full valet cleaning.

I don’t think it’s ever been so clean inside as it is now, and although it cost £20 it was definitely worth it - should last for a few years anyway :-)
