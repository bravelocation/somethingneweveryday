I’m on a diet/detox - although I expect to throughly retox on my upcoming weekend in Spain - so was looking for something healthy but easy to prepare. I went to Stamford Hill Sainsbury’s for a change and bought something I hadn’t seen before - an Mexican Sweet Potato Chilli Veg Pot from Innocent.

It was OK, a little bland for my taste, but reasonably healthy and quick to microwave :-)
