In Edinburgh for the final stage of my European tour with the Halesowen Jolly Boys and Girls, and as usual we spent most of the afternoon and evening in the pub.
Now most of the time was spent in places near where I used to live back in the day, so the only real new thing was trying some different beers I hadn’t had before. There were a few decent ones, but the one that stands out through the boozy memories was one called [Nectar Honey Ale](http://www.caledonian-brewery.co.uk/nectar/index.htm) - mainly because it wasn’t very nice at all :-(

Despite the poor weather the drinking has continued apace this week, which hopefully explains the slight backlog in keeping the blog up-to-date!
