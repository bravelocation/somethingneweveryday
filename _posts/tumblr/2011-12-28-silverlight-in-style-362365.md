I had a few hours free yesterday while Hilary unfortunately had to go to work, so in between a trip to Kwikfit to get my dodgy wheel looked at I managed to spend a couple of hours on version 3 of my Bedside Clock app - which is making a final appearance in the blog (of many!) this year.

What I did learn was how to use styles inside Silverlight to better encapsulate the display settings (color, font size etc.) in one place. This is obviously good practice, and the only reason I haven’t done it before is that I wasn’t 100% sure how.

The app itself is coming along nicely, and I’m hoping to get an improved version out early next year.

I’ve already mentioned that 2012 will be my “Year of Code" when I’m going to try to ship something every month, and I’m not sure whether this will count as Miss January :-)
