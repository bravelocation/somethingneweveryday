It was what’s turning into a usual Wednesday. A long day at work, a couple of drinks afterwards and then worrying what the hell I’m going to do for a new thing.
My emergency list generally involves computer-based innovation, but having taken some ale that wasn’t really an option. However as I was pondering this on the escalator down to the Piccadilly line at Piccadilly Circus, I started watching the busker playing away in the assigned spot at the bottom.
Now there is often someone playing there, and some of them are really quite good - even though often it’s hard to tell what is the backing track and what they are actually playing live. Anyway I thought I’d do something new and give a few pennies out for once, both because they were entertaining and it got me an entry for another day.
