I’ve been getting the train rather than the plane home on Thursday’s for a while now. If I book far enough ahead it does work out cheaper, I get an extra few minutes in bed on Monday morning and it’s easier to do some work. However it’s not as fun being stuck next to the same people for 3 hours on the London-Newcastle bit - especially one regularly smelly bloke who seems to be going to Edinburgh every Thursday too. :-(
This week I managed to use the time productively and have almost completed version 2 of my Bedside Clock app. I’ve now fully integrated the sunrise and sunset information I previously worked on, and now have added a change so the color of the display changes through the night.
What I did learn was how to make that change using a Brush in Silverlight, and also how to change images on the fly - neither of which were quite as straightforward as I  would have thought.
All that’s left to do now is to do a better location lookup implementation than the one I previously did, and I’ll be ready to release into the wild.
P.S. The app is still getting a regular 40-50 downloads each day, and is up to 1207 total downloads as of today (26/03/2011). And to think I would have been happy with double figures!
