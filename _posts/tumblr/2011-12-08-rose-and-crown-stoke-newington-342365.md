Hilary was down in London for some Xmas shopping before we went up to my parents on the weekend, so in the evening we went down to Stoke Newington with Mandy, Andy and Sarah for a drink and a bite to eat.
After we found out there was no food on in the Daniel Defoe pub where we had met up, we went further down Church Street to the Rose and Crown. I’m pretty certain I’ve not been there before, but even if I have I did do something new as well - we’d eaten earlier in the afternoon so I just had a pudding (apple crumble) which is something I’d never have done before!
The pub was quite nice and the food was OK too. The extra distance also meant we could justify getting the bus back rather than walking, which pleased me no end :-)
