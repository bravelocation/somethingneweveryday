We saw prize knob Jeffrey Archer on the TV last week banging on about his “famous Shepherds Pie and Champagne parties” and thought that would make a good theme for doing something on Royal Wedding Day.

I did watch some of the happy couple on TV, and obviously as they are following in me and Hilary’s footsteps in meeting at St. Andrews I’d given them a few tips, but soon got bored and retired to the kitchen to knock out a spicy shepherds pie. Washed down with a nice Cava it was just the job to make sure I could have a nice afternoon kip to avoid the rest of the coverage.
