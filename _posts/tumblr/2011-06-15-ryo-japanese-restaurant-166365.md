Our tour of new Soho food places continued when we went to Ryo Japanese Sushi and Noodle Bar for lunch.

Paul and myself had spotted it when we were in The Glassblower across the road the night before, which was good for Something New. You could get anything on the menu as takeaway except the noodles, so I had some tofu, egg and rice as well as some miso soup thrown in. 

It was all OK without being particularly memorable, although the 15 minute wait wasn’t really worth it in our fast-paced urban lifestyles.
