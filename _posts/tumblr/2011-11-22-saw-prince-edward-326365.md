We needed a pint and a sit down after a long day in meetings at work, so ended up wandering around a little between Victoria and St. James’s Park. We ended up in The Albert on Victoria Street, but on the way we walked past Prince Edward - the man not the pub.

No idea where he was headed, but he was very smartly dressed. We weren’t.
