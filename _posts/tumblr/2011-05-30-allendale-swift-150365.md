I didnâ€™t feel like doing much on a wet Bank Holiday Monday, but thought I should at least leave the house once and headed into Hexham for a pint and some lunch.
I ended up in Wetherspoons as usual and tried a new beer - Allendale Swift. The brewery is a local one, Allendale being a small town up in the hills, and it was a decent beer without being particularly memorable.
