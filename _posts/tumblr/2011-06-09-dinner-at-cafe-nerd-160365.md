Thursday is always a tricky day for me, and this week after being on the lash both Monday and Wednesday and a really busy week at work I was pretty knackered.
Despite the help of my workmates - and I didn’t go with “helping Ross into his chair” - I was at Kings Cross ready to get the train home without reallt anything new.

Anyway, I spotted Cafe Nerd and realised I hadn’t ever got any food from there before, so I bought myself a mushroom and gorgonzola panini, which was really tasty after being toasted.

Not the most exciting new thing for sure, but just enough to keep the streak going - hopefully without too much moaning.
