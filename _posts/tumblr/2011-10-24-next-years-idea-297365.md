Now I’m getting towards the end of the year, I’ve been thinking how I’m going to challenge myself next year (I’m definitely not doing this again!)
Yesterday I happened upon a new website - http://www.dollarapp.com - whch had the great idea of doing a new mobile phone app every month, and charging $1 for it.
Now I’ve been looking for something that is both a challenge and might earn some money, so my plan right now for 2012 is to adapt this and do something very similar for Windows Phone apps. I have lots of ideas that may or may not be any good for phone apps, but as I think I’ve proven once I set myself a goal - however tedious - I’m pretty good at sticking at it :-)
Obviously I may change my mind when I have a “better” idea.
