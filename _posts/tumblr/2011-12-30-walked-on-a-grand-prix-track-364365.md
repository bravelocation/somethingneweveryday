A nice sunny day here in Valencia (around 20C in the sun) so we headed down to the waterfront for a stroll and a bocadillo.
I’ve been down here a few times before, but I hadn’t been down to the harbour that was built for the America’s Cup and is now the Grand Prix race track too. It was nothing particularly exciting to see, but it was a little strange walking across the road where the Formula One cars go racing around.
It wasn’t the only new thing yesterday, as we went to a new place for me (Momofuku?) which served tiny but quite tasty veggie burgers, but for the penultimate post I’m sticking with the sporting themed one.
