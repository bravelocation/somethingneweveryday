Been a funny sort of day, and I have done many “new” things but none of them really worthy of post on their won. So rather than pick the least dull one, I thought I’d list them all. Stand by to be underwhelmed…
Saw Birmingham win a trophy for the first time in my lifetime
Finally put the picture up seen behind the chair in the post of day 21
Added Facebook “Like” buttons and Open Graph information to the Brave Location website
Had my patented “Spicy Quorn Fillets” with noodles instead of the usual baked potatoes
Phew.
It was actually a fantastic day of sport, with England drawing with India in a fluctuating and high scoring group game in the Cricket World Cup, and then Blues beating Arsenal 2-1 in the Carling Cup final with a late winner after a defensive cock up of hilarious proportions. Brilliant!
