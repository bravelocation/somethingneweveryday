Google finally allowed Google Apps users access to Google Plus, so even though I’m very late to the game I’m now a member of the new and slightly underwhelming social network.
I didn’t see many of my immediate contacts on there, but I guess I felt this way when I first joined Twitter back in the day - and look how well that turned out. However things have moved on a long way since then, and I’m not really seeing what this service is adding for me (as opposed to Google getting more data) compared to other similar services.
There’s a good chance I’ll be proven wrong, but I just don’t see how I’ll be moving off Facebook and Twitter any time soon.
