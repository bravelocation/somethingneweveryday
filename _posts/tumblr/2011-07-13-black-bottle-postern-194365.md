On Wednesday we went to a new bar in Bellevue recommended by @stephbu - the Black Bottle Postern.
It’s on Bellevue Way sort of opposite Joey’s and the Hyatt and not that easy to find. However it was very good - a good selection of beers and the food was excellent. The others seemed to enjoy the crispy fried chicken, and the ”chola batura eggplant potato chickpeas hot” I had was excellent too.
Great to have a few beers with some old friends, and will definitely go to the Black Bottle again.
