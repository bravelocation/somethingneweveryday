Too much dieting? Already I’m getting a bit obsessed with it (which is new in itself), but I’m not taking any new data until Saturday so not sure in reality how it’s going.

Anyway, I did two new things in one yesterday. I went to Costa Coffee under the office in Cardinal Place before work for the first time, and ordered a “skinny” latte which I’d never done before. I’d obviously heard people ask that, but it did sound a bit weird saying it myself. Not sure any type of latte is really diet friendly, but too late now.
