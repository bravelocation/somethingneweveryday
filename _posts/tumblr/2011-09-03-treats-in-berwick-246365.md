It was Hilary’s 26 mile charity walk to Holy Island this weekend (just found out she successfully did it!), and she had to start ridiculously early Sunday morning. This meant it made sense for us to stay in Berwick-upon-Tweed on Saturday night, so we got the train up and spent the day mooching around.
Berwick is an interesting place being a disputed border town between England and Scotland for many centuries - happily in England now :-) I had been there before once ages back when I lived in Edinburgh when we got the train down to watch the proper Cup Final on TV, but too be honest we just spent all day in the pu and can’t remember anything about it.
We ended up having some food at the Maltings Theatre and Cinema, and I had something delicious I hadn’t had before - a malteser slice - which was a cake made out of chocolate and maltesers. Luckily it was my “feast day” on my diet so I was allowed one.
