On a staycation this week, which means almost certainly my new things will be a combination of food and computing experiments (no change there then).
On Sunday I used some Quorn Steak Strips in a lovely stir fry I made, something in the now quite extensive Quorn range I hadn’t used before. To be honest they weren’t much difference to other Quorn pieces, which means lovely! Would go great in fajitas I think.
