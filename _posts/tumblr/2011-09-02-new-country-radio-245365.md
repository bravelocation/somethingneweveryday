I’ve been a fan of country music since I spent a summer in the US 3-4 years ago and found that was the most interesting music on the radio. Unfortunately most people in the UK think it’s a bit of a joke - which I guess I did too - but there are loads of great songs and lyrics. If you don’t believe me I can send you a playlist and you can see what you think!
Anyhoo, apart from buying music for my Zune I’ve been able to feed my habit by listening to country songs on my Internet radio, and yesterday I decided to try a new station - AccuRadio Country Hits. The rotation was a bit small and a few songs were on at least twice during the day, but it was nice to try a different selection of the latest country hits.
