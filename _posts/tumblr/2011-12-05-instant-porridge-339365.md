After my previous porridge adventures, I thought that would be a good thing for my dinner seeing as my stomach was still a little upset. I’ve never made my own porridge before - and still haven’t as I got some instant porridge with golden syrup from M&S.
Other than the offputting pot noodle-style adding of hot water, it was actually quite nice although a little dull. I had some more today (the day after) as I’d bought a pack of three and am starting to bore of it a little already, despite it being ideal for these cold winter mornings. I need some tasty additions for my final pot I think.
