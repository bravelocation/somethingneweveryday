I’ve been using my “Bedside Clock” Windows Phone 7 app during my 2 week trip to the US, and after a few final tweaks I’m now happy that it’s done (and to be honest I’m getting a bit bored!)
I’ve set up a holding webpage for the app at http://www.bravelocation.com/bedsideclock and if you have an unlocked developer phone and want to give it a try, you can download the XAP file from there at your own risk!
Next step - which I will hopefully tackle this week - is to get it into the Marketplace so everyone can use it.
