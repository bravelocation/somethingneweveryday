I seem to have been eating a lot of Japanese food recently, so I thought Iâ€™d have a go at making my own teriyaki tofu steaks.

I mostly followed a [recipe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/roastedteriyakitofus_72869) from the BBC website I found although tracking down some sake in Hexham proved impossible at short notice. It turned out pretty well, and tasted really nice even compared to the Soho restaurants fare :-)
