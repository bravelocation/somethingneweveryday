Not a great day, as I finally succumbed to the bug that’s been going around our office recently. I went straight to bed when I got home from work, but luckily earlier in the day I’d been given my first ever free copy of the weekly China Daily paper.
It was actually quite interesting, and appears everything is going very well in China. I am now thinking of moving my business there as there are lots of opportunities and helpful government officials too.
No sport pages though. No idea how they forgot about those, as that’s clearly the most important bit of any paper.
