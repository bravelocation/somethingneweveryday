This is probably the lamest post so far, but I don’t have anything else (and I’d promised Ross I would!). There is a weak moral to the story too at the end if you can stand the excitement.
Just about every day at work we have long discussions about where to go to lunch, but in reality we only ever go to a few places. One of those is Wok To Walk, a pretty decent noodle bar on Brewer Street. I always have the same selection: Udon Noodles with Tofu and “Hot Asia” sauce - the only reasonably spicy one. 
In the spirit of trying new things, I decided to go for “Shanghai” sauce instead. How brave.
The trouble is, it wasn’t half as nice as the usual sauce. I’m pretty much addicted to spicy food, and even though the Hot Asia isn’t that hot, at least it has a bit of kickin it. The “Shanghai” was just a bit dull.
Moral: I guess it’s something like “it’s good to try something new, but it won’t always be better”.
It’s been a long day.
