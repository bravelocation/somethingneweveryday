Out at the [Taphouse Grill](http://www.taphousegrill.com/index.html) in Bellevue after work, which was good for a new thing at it has a vast list of different beers available.

I went for a [Big Sky Scape Goat Ale](http://www.bigskybrew.com/Our_Beers/Scape_Goat), which was fine but the most distinctive thing about it was it’s name.

It was good to catch up with Craig and Jack, and we had a good old fashioned Microsoft vs. Google who’s-the-worst showdown :-)
