As I flagged up [a month back](/registered-2-new-domains-18365) I’ve got a couple of new domains I registered for some side projects I’ve been playing with. For one of them I decided it was time to put up a holding page, and was/am going to use Google App Engine to run the site.

However it’s a bit of effort to get the App Engine to use a custom domain, especially because in some slightly strange way you have to confirm you won the site via SMS. I’d already used my phone for [http://www.bravelocation.com](http://www.bravelocation.com) so I’m a bit stuck. However it was late, so I’m going to have another go this weekend,
Still not giving too much away on what the site is just yet - it’s nothing fantastic - but I’ve posted the logo that you would have seen on the holding page if I hadn’t failed to host it.

P.S. If you’re following along in real time I know I’m 2 days behind posting, but the streak is still on (up to yesterday anyway!)
