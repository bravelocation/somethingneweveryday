Taking advantage of my new, ["super-fast broadband"](/home-broadband-speed-improved-x4-84365) I decided to go mad and try watching the baseball in HD.Â 

Usually I had to force the speed back to much slower otherwise the picture was too blocky, but now it stayed HD for just about all the time - and smoothly scaled down as appropriate.

This was much better, and the Mets even won for once!
