This one’s thanks to my friend Saqib, who showed us something we didn’t know before on Wednesday.
I was wondering why I couldn’t snap a window to the right hand side of my left hand monitor (if that makes sense). I’d only used the mouse before to do so (which doesn’t work in a multi-monitor setup), and although I knew about the Windows Key-Up/Left/Right combination but assumed that would work the same as the mouse. But no - using the mouse cycles through the different monitors just how you’d want.
Whenever I learn a keyboard shortcut I always wish I knew more (and could type better!)
