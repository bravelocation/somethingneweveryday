As I’ve moaned about already, this week has been a very busy one, so by 4pm Friday I was starting to flag. I decided to treat myself to a can of something fizzy from the fridge, and I had some Seagrams Ginger Beer, something I hadn’t had before.

It was OK but a little tame compared to the occasional ginger beer I’ve had before. Not sure why US food always seems a little bland? A waste of a treat really, but another day ticked off.
