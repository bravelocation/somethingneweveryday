Where we work in Soho it’s quite near to some “interesting” establishments, although nowhere near as dodgy as it was 6-7 years ago when you’d regularly get accosted on some of the side streets. However I was walking down the usually semi-respectable Brewer Street after a long day at work, and I was approached by a woman offering me all kinds of services.

This was actually a bit off. I don’t mind those things happening if people want to find them out, but it’s not really acceptable to get hassled in broad daylight when you’re just on your way to get something to eat after leaving work down a busy street.

Obviously I refused and went to get some noodles for me tea instead.

Still it was something new, and things have been a bit slow this week (as you’ll soon see!)
