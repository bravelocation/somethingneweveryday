I love [Memolane](http://www.memolane.com/) - mainly because I had a similar idea a while back and never got off my arse and did anything about it. To be fair they’ve done a great job of implementing it, much better than I would have done.
If you haven’t checked it out, the site archives your socila media output (Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, blog posts etc.) and organises them into a timeline so you can look back and see what you were doing back in the day.
Anyway my new thing was to integrate my timeline (well the public part of it) into my website using their new widget. You can see the results at [http://www.bravelocation.com/about](http://www.bravelocation.com/about)
