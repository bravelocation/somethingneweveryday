The week of lunch experiments finished with a trip to [Noodle Noodle](http://www.noodle-noodle.co.uk/), a Chinese restaurant/noodle bar on Buckingham Palace Road.

Mixed reviews of the food here. I had some stir fried vegetables and noodles which were OK if nothing particularly memorable, and the chicken noodle soup Paul and Mark had looked very basic.

Last day in London this year (indeed for a while as Iâ€™m travelling for work and pleasure for a couple of weeks after Xmas) and a slightly disappointing way to finish the run of new lunch venues.
