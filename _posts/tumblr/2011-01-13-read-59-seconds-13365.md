I didn’t get back home until late last night, and was too tired to make my update - but don’t worry I did do something new :-)
I spent an enjoyable hour or three on the train home finishing an excellent book called “59 Seconds” by Richard Wiseman.
The book’s blurb explains it better than I can:
"Richard Wiseman’s latest book exposes self-help myths, and presents scientifically proven techniques that help you achieve your aims and ambitions in less than a minute.  From mood to memory, persuasion to procrastination, and resilience to relationships, 59 Seconds presents the new science of rapid change."
It’s an entertaining read, and I found myself laughing out loud at times. Some useful tips in there, but most interesting is  the debunking of popular myths that have been proven not to be true.
I’d definitely recommend the book, especially at the low, low Kindle price of £4.05. More details at  http://59seconds.wordpress.com/
