I read a few days ago about a simple but really useful service called CodeGuard, which basically logs into your website via FTP and copies it to a safe server. This is really useful, as well as providing early detection for any corruption or viruses.
I set it up for the previously unreliable Yeltz ForumÂ I help maintain, and it worked straightaway without a hitch. You get 1 free site which is fine for me. Definitely recommended.
