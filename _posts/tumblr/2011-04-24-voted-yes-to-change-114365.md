I can’t remember ever having a referendum that I’ve been old enough to vote in, and with my postal vote I’ve now voted Yes to switching to AV rather than the current “first past the post” for general elections.
To be honest I don’t think it will make that much difference and am not 100% sure about my decision but the main factor was the ridiculous arguments of the “No” team, basically saying it would cost lots of money (it won’t) and people won’t understand it - how patronising can you get? Also you can usually be on pretty safe ground if you vote the opposite way to George Osborne.
Actually that’s the real attraction to AV in that you can vote exactly how you feel, so I can now much more easily vote “anyone but Tory” and have half a chance that my voice might be heard.
