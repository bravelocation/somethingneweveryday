Flatmate Ben asked me to take a look at his computer as it had a virus. I’m not really a PC expert despite spending most of my life on them, and when I started it up it turned out he’d got a really horrible on called System Tool.

It’s a fake virus checking program which hooks itself into system and continuously nags you to pay money to sort your system. It disables most of the obvious ways of tracking down what it’s actually doing, so at first I was bit stumped.

However searching on my own untainted PC I found a really excellent video at [http://www.removevirus.org/system-tool-2011](http://www.removevirus.org/system-tool-2011) explaining exactly how to get rid it, which is actually pretty easy if you know how. It all looks a lot more healthy now, so hopefully it’s back to being usable again.
