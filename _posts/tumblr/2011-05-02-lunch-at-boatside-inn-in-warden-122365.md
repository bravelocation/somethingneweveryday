Monday was the last day of my extended between-the-bank-holidays vacation, so we decided to take advantage of the nice weather and walk down the Tyne to Warden for lunch.

The pub there is the [Boatside Inn](http://theboatsideinn.com/), which is a nice little pub which does decent food and has a nice beer garden where you can sit out. It wasn’t as warm as you’d hope despite being very sunny. Hilary had been there before but it was my first time, and will definitely go back again - although I was struggling with my knees on the walk home :-(
