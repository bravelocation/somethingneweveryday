I thought it would be good to use Expedia - where I’d booked the hotel - to give a review of the Hotel Kong Arthur where we’d stayed in Copenhagen a couple of weeks ago.
The hotel wasn’t that bad, but it wasn’t quite as good as you’d expect from the hotel details and reviews. I may have been more critical because it rained almost non-stop while we were there, but there were a few things that weren’t quite right. Ho hum.
As of Saturday afternoon the review hasn’t gone live yet, but they said it would take 5-7 days for it to appear which seems rather cautious.
