I was surprised when I was told there were tickets available for Arsenal’s Champions League Qualifier against Udinese at The Emirates, so it seemed too good an opportunity to miss.

I just about managed to get to see the kickoff after leaving work late, and had a seat just 6 rows from the front just to the left of the goal at The Clock End. The stadium is quite nice if a little soulless, and the crowd - at least where I was sitting and the people rolling up late - were surprisingly quiet and nicely behaved.

The game itself was quite good for the neutral. Arsenal took an early lead through Walcott and should have had another soon afterwards, but after that Udinese battled back into it and were unlucky to lose 1-0 in the end. Their fans were great and put the home fans to shame with their passionate support and singing.

Definitely well worth going, but I’m glad I don’t have to watch Arsenal’s tiki-taka-lite football every week.
