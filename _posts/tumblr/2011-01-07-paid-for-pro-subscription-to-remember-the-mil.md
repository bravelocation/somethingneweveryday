I’ve been using Remember The Milk to manage my multiple lists of things for several months now, and it’s by far the best task tracking software I’ve ever used.
It’s hard to quantify what makes it so good, but what I like most are the simplicity plus the super-cool way you can set all the task options by using the Smart Add functions when typing the task details. Plus it’s got a cartoon cow as it’s logo.
Anyway, it’s now become an essential part of my life, so I wanted to support the team and spent $25 on purchasing a Pro subscription. Well worth the money I think.
