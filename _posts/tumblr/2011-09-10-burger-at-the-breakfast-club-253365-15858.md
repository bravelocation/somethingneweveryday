After getting back from Poland at stupid-o’clock late on Friday night, for the first time in a while I didn’t go home at the weekend and stayed over in London.
Saturday evening I joined flatmate Mandy’s quest to find the best veggie burger in town and we went to [The Breakfast Club](http://www.thebreakfastclubcafes.com/) in Islington, somewhere I hadn’t been before.

The burger was nice - it was a bit like Sosmix which isn’t a bad thing - and the chunky chips were OK too. We went for mohitos, and then rounded the evening off by going to see the excellent [Troll Hunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/) at the cinema.
