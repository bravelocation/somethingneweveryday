Is this blog becoming obsessed with food? Almost certainly as my stupid but so far successful diet has taken over my every thought :-(

I was looking for something healthy but new to cook, and somehow I ended up on Jamie Oliver’s website for the first time. It’s all very professional but there are a few decent recipes, and I decided to make his [cool Mexican bean wraps](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetarian-recipes/cool-mexican-bean-wraps).

I made a few minor adjustments, like adding in refried beans and using much more chilli powder but despite looking rather dull (no pictures I’m afraid) they tasted pretty pukka as I beleive I am obliged to say.
