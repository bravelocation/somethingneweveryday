Haven’t been to Nando’s for ages, and unless it’s a diet “feast day” I won’t for a while. However when looking for something new for me tea I spotted an Innocent “Portuguese Red Pepper Piri Piri vegpot which was as close I was going to get in a healthy way.

It was actually quite nice, not desperately spicy but a definite kick to it and definitely very good for me. May try again in the future (with some chips lol)
