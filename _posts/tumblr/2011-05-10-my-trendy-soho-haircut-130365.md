Definitely a tabloid headline this one!
I’ve been getting sick of getting my hair cut in Hexham. There are 3 barbers there and all very cheap and all not very good. So I decided to go and splash out £9 on a hairdresser in that London. Well Mr Toppers on Old Compton Street, but even though I say it myself I do look more handsome than usual :-)
