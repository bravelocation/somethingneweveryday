I was going to do some more work on my Windows Phone app, but got stymied by the slow verification process. Luckily I did do something new today at lunchtime
We were looking for a Thai place we used to go to on Broadwick Street but it turns out it shut a while back. However we saw a juice bar/sandwich place called [Crussh](http://www.crussh.com/) nearby so we though we’d give it a go.

I wasn’t particularly impressed. I had a butternut, red aduki and gingko soup, which sounded interesting but actually was a little dull. The sandwich choice was a little poor although the juice @markath had looked OK. Probably won’t be rushing back.

Only now have I found out what gingko actually is. From Wikipedia it appears it’s actually [Gingko Bilboa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba) which is supposed to enhance your memory and attention although studies - as ever - seem inconclusive. In my very limited experience I can’t remember if it helped this afternoon.
