As you may know I’ve been running the website for my artist friend Josie for many years now. Josie is in London right now for a week or so and at dinner on Wednesday we agreed on a couple of small changes to the site, which I did on the train home on Thursday.

The first was after Josie made the interesting observation that everyone looks at pictures on Facebook now, so you expect to be able to click on the image and go to the next one in the series. I hadn’t really considered that as an common interface feature before, but it was both obviously true and easy to implement that I made the change.

The other update was to add the ubiquitous Facebook Like button to the site too. Now I’d done this before, but it’s really hard to test it’s set up correctly as if you’re the admin of the application you don’t appear to be able to “like” it as well. After a few tweaks to the page design I think it both works and looks reasonable.

You can see the results as well as one of Josie’s paintings at [http://www.josiemccoy.co.uk/gallery/image.aspx/icons/Juno](http://www.josiemccoy.co.uk/gallery/image.aspx/icons/Juno)
