Yesterday was the final day of stage 2 of our European tour, and we flew back home for a brief rest via Copenhagen Airport - where I hadnâ€™t been before.

We got the metro out to the airport, which was typically efficient and the airport was very nice too - I guess after Heathrow anywhere never seems that busy.
Glad to be home for a couple of nights in my own bed before we set off again later in the week!
