As you probably know, I spend most working weeks down in London, and reasonably often fly down to Heathrow from Newcastle.
Today, I thought I’d try getting the Heathrow Express to Paddington (and then the Bakerloo line to Piccadilly Circus) rather than getting the Piccadilly line direct there.

Plus points:

* Quite a bit quicker getting into the office - despite being delayed by about 7 minutes on the Tube it took about 20 minutes less than usual
* Much more comfortable - nice seats and plenty of room

Minus points:

* Much more expensive - cost £18 for a single paying on the day rather £4.50 using my Oyster card on the Tube.

So will I do it again? Definitely if I’m in a rush or if have lots of bags, as it’s no fun in the rush hour on the Piccadilly line with lots of luggage. 

However on a normal commute - and sadly this is pretty normal for me - saving 20 minutes isn’t worth £13.50
