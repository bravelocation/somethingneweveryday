Yesterday we went to see The King’s Speech at the Hexham Forum Cinema.
Going to the Forum is always fun, as it’s a real old-fashioned non-multiplex cinema. We tried to book online, but they had this bizarre rule in the system that you couldn’t book 2 seats in a block of 3 because it would leave one on it’s own. Even more fun was we had those exact same seats when we bought the tickets at the cinema.
I didn’t know what to expect from the film, despite it winning all those Oscars. However it was really good, funny in parts and really moving. Definitely recommended.
The only pain was the unbelievably inconsiderate people sitting behind us who managed to crackle their sweet wrappers loudly through the entire 2 hours. Despite that and the fire alarm briefly going off right at a crucial bit at the end, it was a fun evening out, and at least we could walk home afterwards.
