It’s seems ages since I [moved out of my flat in Pimlico](/moved-out-of-pimlico-19365), with a long trip to the US in-between, but yesterday I finally moved into my new room in North London.

I definitely think I’m going to be happy there, although I am missing the convenience of Pimlico. The Victoria line was a nightmare last night, and Oxford Circus is hell at rush hour (will be using Piccadilly line in future for sure), but the distance means there isn’t any practical alternative to the tube.

In other news, I’m not sure my jet-lag has returned or not. I was in bed by 9pm last night after an early start, and was awake for a few hours during the night, but I’m still declaring [the food experiment](/trying-no-food-on-plan-anti-jet-lag-diet-3536) a success :-)
