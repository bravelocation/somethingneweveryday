I was sick of getting the tube down to Victoria, as even early in the morning it’s insanely busy. So when there were even more delays I jumped off at Finsbury Park and decided to experiment getting the bus.
I knew I could get plenty of buses to Camden and then a 24 to Victoria, but out the back of the 253 I saw a C2 going to Victoria so decided to get that. However it turned off just before I could get it, so I had a 10 minute wait for the next one. However it was sort of worth it as I got to go round by London Zoo, Albany Street and down Portland Place, all places I hadn’t been before.
However all in all it took best part of an hour and a quarter door to door, so not the most optimum commute unfortunately.
