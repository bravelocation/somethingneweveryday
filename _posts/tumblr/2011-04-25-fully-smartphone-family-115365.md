I’m very happy with my work provided Windows Phone 7 phone, but that means my Google Nexus One Android phone I bought a while back was not being used. Hilary was still using her old Samsung not-smart phone, but with a bit of work we’re now a completely smartphone household.
The main work was to extract all her old contacts and type them into our Google Domain web interface, which means they automatically get synched once the phone was setup. Other than that, it was easy to wipe the phone of all my assorted crap and start again. How exciting!
