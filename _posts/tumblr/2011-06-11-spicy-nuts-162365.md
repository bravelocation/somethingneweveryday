Spicy Nuts (162/365)
Following on from my recent culinary experiments, Hilary bought me the “Little Book of Tapas” for more things to try. My first new thing was to try the salty and spicy nuts (insert your own joke here).
As usual they turned out better than they looked. The interesting colour is made by caramelizing sugar in with the spices when frying the pre-roasted nuts, and a combination of paprika, cumin and chilli made them quite spicy too.
