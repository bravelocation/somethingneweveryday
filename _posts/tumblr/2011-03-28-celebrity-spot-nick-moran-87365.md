Haven’t done of these for a while, but on my way down to Tesco near Piccadilly Circus after work, I heard some loud “geezer” walking behind me in a voice that sounded familiar in some way. I turned around, and it was Nick Moran, best known to me from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
Not desperately exciting,but something new and my first celebrity in a few weeks - which is quite disappointing seeing as I work in the middle of Soho.
