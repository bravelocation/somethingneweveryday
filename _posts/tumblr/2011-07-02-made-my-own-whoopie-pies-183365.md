Made my own whoopie pies (183/365)
After Thursday’s whoopie pie experience, the obvious step was to try making some of my own.
I found what I hoped would be a good recipe from a Brighton-based bakery and gave it a go. Results as usual don’t look great in the picture, but they are a quite nice biscuit/cake combination, and the vanilla buttercream is lovely.
