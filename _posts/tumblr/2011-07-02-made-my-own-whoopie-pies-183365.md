After [Thursday’s whoopie pie experience](/had-my-first-whoopie-pie-181365), the obvious step was to try making some of my own.

I found what I hoped would be a good [recipe](http://theartofbeingperfect.blogspot.com/2010/04/best-whoopie-pie-recipe.html) from a Brighton-based bakery and gave it a go. Results as usual don’t look great in the picture, but they are a quite nice biscuit/cake combination, and the vanilla buttercream is lovely.
