A whole day of pretty miserable new things.
I was due to fly home from Seattle yesterday evening, but after spending 2 hours on the tarmac we went nowhere. There was a hydraulic fault in the backup systems they couldn’t repair, so they needed a new part before being allowed to take off.
I’ve done the SEA-LHR trip many times and that’s the first time the flight has been cancelled.
We have been put up in a DoubleTree hotel near the airport. First time I’ve stayed in one and it’s OK. The food is reasonable and I’ve been parked in the bar all day working whilst waiting for my rescheduled flight this evening.
What fun.
