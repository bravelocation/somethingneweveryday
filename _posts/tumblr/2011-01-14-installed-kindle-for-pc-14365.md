Very slow day, being busy working (at home) and crappy weather so didn’t do much new.

What I did do was try the Kindle for PC application, so I could refer to some reference books I have without going to the massive effort of getting my Kindle out of my bag.

Actually it’s really good being able to get access to code snippets etc. from the machine you’re working on - although not being able to easily copy and paste is a bit of a pain.

The main reason I like this and the Windows Phone 7 app is that it gives you a little more confidence that the Kindle format is a long term, and that my investment in Kindle eBooks won’t be a technological dead-end.
