I’ve written before  about our continual lunchtime prevarications about where to go for lunch - there really is too much choice in Soho.
For a change yesterday we went to Arigato, a Japanese supermarket just around the corner from our office and I had a bento box for lunch - something I hadn’t done before.
I had a teriyaki tofu box, which had 6 large pieces of fried tofu in a lot of teriyaki sauce, plus sticky rice, what seemed like a mini-portion of mashed potato but probably wasn’t, fried onion and a mystery orange vegetable/fruit.
It was very tasty, and decent value (for Soho!) at £4.80. Recommended.
