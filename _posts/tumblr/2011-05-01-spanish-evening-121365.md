I’m off to Valencia in a couple of weeks to visit my friends Frank and Josie, and as usual I was thinking of brushing up on my pretty awful Spanish before I went.

However for once I did something about it. I listened to my “One Day Spanish” CD all the way to the end for the first time. To complete the theme I did it while watching Valencia lose to Osasuna on the Sky Player.

I’ll try to do another few listens before I head out next week, but has it improved my rudimentary Spanish? Si!
