I’m home alone this weekend as Hilary is on a walking holiday in Cornwall, so I didn’t want to make a great effort cooking before watching the Champions League Final. So I thought I’d try something new and quick, and cooked some Thai Fried Bananas.

I found a [very simple recipe](http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1613,158167-244199,00.html) online, in which basically you fry the bananas in butter and then sprinkle with sugar when brown. Very easy and very tasty.
