Making the most of my last few days in London this year by stepping up the quest for exciting new lunch places.
Yesterday we went to Lime Orange, what looks like a brand new Korean restaurant on Vauxhall Bridge Road. I had a tasty vegetarian bibimbapÂ which was an interesting bowl of rice and assorted vegetables with a fried egg on top, and Paul had a meat based version with some very stinky Kimchee.
All very tasty, and may make it on to our new rotation.
Also, make sure you check out the comedy misspelling on their website!
