I’d just got back from Newcastle on the train from early Xmas shopping, and it started raining again, so I thought I’d nip into [The Phoenix](http://hexham.myvillage.com/place/the-phoenix-hexham) pub in Hexham.

Now I’d not been in before, but even more interestingly it was taking advantage of the new clarification of the TV rules and was showing the Man Utd. v Newcastle game even though it was 3pm Saturday afternoon. This was also new for me, but could well become a habit.

It was a great game, with a classic back to the wall performance from Newcastle, with the draw making a pretty full pub very happy!
