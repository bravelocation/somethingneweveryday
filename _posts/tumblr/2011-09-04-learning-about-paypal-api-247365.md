Iâ€™ve been thinking about doing some integration of payment services into a website (not this one!), and on Sunday I spent a half hour or so learning about the Paypal API and the options available if I went down that route.
It actually looks quite good, and there are lots of options from the simple to a full-blown integration of your own shopping basket.
Be interesting in hearing if anyone out there has used it themselves and would recommend using it - and if not what are the alternatives?
