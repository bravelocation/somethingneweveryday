I was chatting to my friend [O](http://www.facebook.com/apavamontri) yesterday and he was telling me about a web page toolkit he was using called [Bootstrap].(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

It was made by a couple of designers from Twitter and looked quite nice, so I thought I’d have a play with it. The results can be seen at the latest incarnation of my [Brave Location website](http://www.bravelocation.com/), and looks quite decent even if I say it myself.

The only pain was that initially it didn’t work properly in IE9, and it took me ages to figure out that a DOCTYPE tag was essential or the whole thing didn’t render cleanly at all.

Will definitely consider using Bootstrap in the future, as it’s really easy to get a nice design without too much effort or CSS skills (of which I don’t have many!)
