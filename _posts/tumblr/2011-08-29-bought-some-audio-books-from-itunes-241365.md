First of all I must stress the audio books were for Hilary, so she can have something to listen on her 26 mile [charity walk](http://www.justgiving.com/Hilary-MacCallum) she’s doing at the weekend (still time to sponsor her if you want to at the link above!)

Neither of us had bought an audio book before, so I braved the unbelievably shite program that is iTunes to help her figure it out. Not exactly news, but iTunes really is the worst program I have to use with any frequency - navigation is terrible and at times very counter intuitive. Obviously it’s all my fault though as everyone knows Apple’s software can’t be bettered.

Anyhoo after a couple of false starts we managed to download 12 hours or so of novels, so hopefully she’ll have enough to get her through the day!
