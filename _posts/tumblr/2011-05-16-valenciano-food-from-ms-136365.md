I always like to try to get a tortilla at the airport on the way home from Valencia, but no such luck this time. 
However after getting the Gatwick Express to Victoria I thought I’d pop into M&S there to pick up a few bits of food and saw one in there. It was topped by caramelised onions which I haven’t seen in Spain, but washed down with some fresh Valencia Orange Juice it was very tasty indeed, if not quite the authentic thing.
