As an obsessive list maker, I love Evernote for keeping notes on just about anything. it’s cross-platform nature means they can be accessible from just about anywhere. However the web interface is a bit lame, so I was very pleased when they released a Windows Phone 7 app this week, which I tried for the first time on Friday.
It’s pretty simplistic but works great, and is so much better than trying to use the web interface on the phone (and much better than the Android app I used to use too). Definitey recommended.
