We were having a few people around on Sunday, so I decided to make some cupcakes (a new thing). Hilary also was baking and made - amongst lots of things - some chocolate muffins. Bake-off!

I think you can see from the pictures that Hilary’s muffins with the chocolate drizzle and the mini-egg on top clearly win on presentation against my “St. George’s Day” themed cupcakes. However I think I did win on taste (banana and chocolate chip) and moistness, so we’ll call it a draw :-)
