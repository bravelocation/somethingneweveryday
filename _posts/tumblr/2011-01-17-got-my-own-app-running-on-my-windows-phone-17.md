My registration to be a Windows Phone 7 developer got accepted after just 6 days, which means I can now install my apps in progress on my phone.
This means tonight I can properly test out my “Bedside Clock” app, to see if it’s actually any good.
One thing I did find was that the values from the accelerometer are pretty sensitive. I have a feature which puts the time at full brightness for a few seconds if you move the handset - useful if you wake up and really need to see the time clearly - but until I rounded the values being returned from the accelerometer it was never “still” so never faded out.
I’ve got a few small tweaks before I upload it to the app store for others to try, but it’s great to be able to have my own software on my own phone.
