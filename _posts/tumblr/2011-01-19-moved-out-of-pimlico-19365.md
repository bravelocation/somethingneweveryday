After 6 months of living in delightful Pimlico, I’ve decided that “location, location, location” isn’t actually anything, and I’m moving to South Tottenham to live during the week with friends Mandy and Ben.
Pimlico itself was great, in a really central location and some nice bars and places to eat, but the flat I was staying in was completely overpriced. Once it started falling apart - door frame coming off, bathroom tap failing - and the landlord not fixing the problems despite promising to do so, it was definitely time to move on.
It’ll be different but hopefully good being in a shared house with nice people, and the commute isn’t actually that much longer. From flat to office on Victoria line from Seven Sisters to Oxford Circus only took about 40 minutes this morning which is only about 10 minutes longer.
I’m on my way home to Northumberland right now and am in the US for work for the next couple of weeks, so I’m not officially moving in yet until early February, but I’m definitely done with Pimlico for now.
