Thursday was a horrible day in Edinburgh with non-stop rain (which has been following me around), but luckily we were booked in to play skittles at The Sheep Heid Inn in Duddingston.
This is a really interesting old place, and according to their website theyâ€™ve had skittles there since the 16th century. I played pretty terrible, but it was a excellent way to pass a few hours on a wet day.
