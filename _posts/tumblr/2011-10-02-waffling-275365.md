Waffling (275/365)I got a waffle iron for my birthday and with my ongoing diet havenâ€™t had chance to use it yet. Today was the day, and I decided to christen it by making some banana and almond waffles.
I had no idea how they were going to turn out, especially as I spread the rather gungy batter on the griddle. However as you can see they looked pretty decent, and tasted great too. Really happy as they were easy to make, and will definitely be using this very often.
