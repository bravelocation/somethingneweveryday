I’d just got my haircut, so I thought I’d have some lunch in the Hexham Wetherspoons. I always have 5-bean chilli and chips in there for superstitious purposes as it always seemed to bring the mighty Yeltz luck in away games if I ate it beforehand (although a 7-1 defeat yesterday shows I have to be at the game for it to “work”).
However it’s the Wetherspoons Real Ale Festival at the moment, so I thought I’d try something new to drink and had a Caledonian Doc Kennedys Lipsmacker Lemon Ale.
To be honest it was a little disappointing. I’m not a massive fan of fruit ales, but I couldn’t even detect a hint of lemon in the beer. It was OK, but definitely nothing special - a bit like Wetherspoons I suppose :-)
