Cooked some disappointing rostis (240/365)Hadn’t done any “new” cooking for a while, and flicking through the usually reliable Simon Rimmer''s cookbook I thought I have a go at making some leek and garlic rostis.
Now I followed the instructions to the letter, but to be honest they weren’t very nice at all. I don’t think the taters were probably cooked long enough, and maybe they were made too thick as they weren’t particularly cooked well in the middle.
Very disappointing.
