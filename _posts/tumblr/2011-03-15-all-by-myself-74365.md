The troubles at the mighty Halesowen Town have been well documented [elsewhere](http://www.yeltz.co.uk/) - if you don’t know what’s happening by now it’s too sad to relate, and all you need to know is after nearly 140 years of existence we’re on the edge of folding.

I hadn’t been to see us play for a while, so an evening game at Chesham was a great opportunity to see for myself how far we’ve fallen, and do something new - go to a game on the tube after work.

We used to take loads of fans to every away game, but understandable apathy and disgust at the situation means for a while I thought I was the only Yeltz fan there. I always stand behind the goal we’re attacking, and for sure I was standing on my own there. We’re bottom of the league so I had the lowest of low expectations for the game, but although we lost 3-0 we never gave up trying, which under the circumstances was a fantastic effort.

We did come close to scoring on a couple of occasions, which meant I could count 6 of us encouraging the team. Popular consensus means it could be the lowest away turnout we’ve ever taken, but completely understandable. I’m really glad I went, and really hope it isn’t the last time I see the club play that’s been a big part of my life.

It took over 2 hours to get home, as the Metropolitan line goes so far out of London it’s not really like the rest of the underground, so I was probably back after my fellow sufferers got back to the Midlands.
