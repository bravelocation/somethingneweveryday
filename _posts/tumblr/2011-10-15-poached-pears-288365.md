Poached Pears (288/365)Needed something nice to eat on my Saturday feast day, and the day before weâ€™d been watching Nigel Slater on TV do some poached pears covered with cream, crushed biscuit and melted dark chocolate. That fitted the bill nicely, so we gave it a go.
The pears were poached in some sugared water plus a bit of vanilla essense, and turned out very nice, quite light but tasty.
The better than usual presentation you can see in the picture was down to Hilary, who drizzled the melted Green and Blacks chocolate over the top in a very artistic way!
