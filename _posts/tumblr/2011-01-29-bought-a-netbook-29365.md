I’ve been looking for a lightweight laptop for a while - something I can do some development on separate to my work laptop that isn’t going to weigh me down as I travel around.
After MUCH planning, I decided to buy an Asus Eee PC 1015PE from the Microsoft Store in Bellevue. It’s a really nice size, and the keyboard is just big enough to be comfortable to type on. I’m writing this entry on it right now.
It’s been a pretty miserable day here weather-wise, so I’ve had fun in my hotel room installing a whole bunch of software on my new machine. the list so far is:
Google Chrome
Evernote
Python
Mercurial
Google App Engine SDK
Microsoft Windows Phone 7 Developer Tools
Microsoft Security Essentials
Zune
Paint.Net
As usual I’m trying very hard only to install just what I need to work and not put any crap on here, but overtime those good intentions usually fail.
BTW the Microsoft Store is actually pretty good, and loads nicer than the Apple store just a few shops down. Lots more going on, a variety of different things to look at and play with, and a noticeable lack of smugness from the staff :-)
