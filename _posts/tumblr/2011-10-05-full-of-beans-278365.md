3 meals, beans in everyone of them.

Thatâ€™s the story really. Breakfast of scrambled eggs and beans at work, bean soup for lunch then more beans for me tea. Never done that before.

Surprisingly, none of the obvious post-bean symptoms.

Hoping it all pays off in my latest weigh-off at the weekend.
