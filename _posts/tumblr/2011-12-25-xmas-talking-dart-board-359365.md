Very hard to do something new on Xmas Day, as half the point and the enjoyment is doing the same thing as usual. For us this meant having a lie-in, opening presents, phoning the family, eating too much food at Hilaryâ€™s parents, me falling asleep and Hilary going for a post-meal walk, tea, walking home and then slobbing out in front of the TV.

Anyway I did have something new thanks to my sister Jenny who got me a fun present just so I could have something new (a most thoughtful gift!) - a dart board that shouts out when you hit different areas of the board. Good fun, and goes nicely in my office as a fun desktop distraction.
