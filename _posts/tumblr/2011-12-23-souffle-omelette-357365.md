It’s officially Xmas and my diet is on hold, so the serious eating has begun.

I was browsing around t’Internet looking for stuff to make for Boxing Day, and happened upon Delia’s website and a recipe for [Souffle Omelette](http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/vegetarian-food/a-souffle-omelette-with-three-cheeses-and-chives.html). Sounded like something nice (and new!) for lunch so I gave it a go.

I’d have never have thought of making an omelette like this, and it was delicious. Very light, and with the 3 different types of cheese in it very tasty. Let’s be ‘aving you!
