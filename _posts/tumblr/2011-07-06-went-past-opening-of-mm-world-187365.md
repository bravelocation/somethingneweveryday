I headed back into Soho after work as I had a full loyalty card at Wok to Walk burning in my pocket, and after I’d had my noodles I thought I’d head back via Leicester Square as I thought there might be a Harry Potter film premiere that might be worth a nose.

However it turns out the big attraction was the opening of [M&M World](http://worldchocolateguide.com/shop/mms-world/london/), a store dedicated to the sweets. That all seems a bit strange to me, but I thought I’d briefly join the crowds to see what all the fuss was about. There were some giant M&Ms dancing around, and I saw a celebrity leaving which only later I found out was X-Factor “star” Alexandra Burke. I think most of the crowd were waiting for JLS, but I wasn’t so I headed off.

All very underwhelming really, but definitely something new.
