A new thing born out of mild desperation.

Hilary was out at work and I had to wait in for a parcel to be picked up so I couldn’t nip out and get some food in, so I had to make do with whatever was in the house.

I made myself a sandwich but didn’t have any margarine in, so thought I’d try veggie ham, banana and - just for excitement - some Branston pickle.

It was actually better than it sounds, and the ingredients went quite well together.
