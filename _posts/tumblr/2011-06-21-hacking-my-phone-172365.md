It’s been a dev-centric week, as I’ve both been working from home and participating in the Bing Europe Hack Days.

The hack days are a couple of days where everyone in the office is free to work on interesting projects or ideas that may or may not turn into something useful. Organised by @intven, it’s a great experience and a real shame I wasn’t in the office to participate more.

However, I worked at home on an experimental Windows Phone 7 app that worked reasonably well, and what I did new on Tuesday was to figure out how the Pivot View control works, as well as integrating the Bing Maps control. Can’t give many more details away right now I’m afraid.
