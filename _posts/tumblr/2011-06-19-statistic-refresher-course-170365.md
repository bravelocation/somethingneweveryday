Back in the day I did actually gain a degree in statistics, although through lack of use I remember very little of what I learnt.
Only recently in my work at Bing has it been useful to dredge up my stats knowedge, and my friend and colleague Francesco shared a really useful link to a new book called “Statistics For Programmers" which I read on Sunday - the first time I’d read a stats book since graduating.
It was a really useful book to read and I now remember a few more things I used to know, as well as having a couple of useful ideas on things to try in my work.
