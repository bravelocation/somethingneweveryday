As I’ve mentioned before, for me Saturday is sausage sandwich day. It’s not really a tradition, it’s just I like eating them so when I’m at home I have one.
My Saturday routine also usually involves listening to the Danny Baker Show on Radio Five Live whilst having a bath. Danny is currently undergoing cancer therapy, from which hopefully he’ll make a speedy recovery. His phone-in shows have been brilliant over the years, and the current show is no exception.
Regular listeners will know that one of the best features on the show is the “Sausage Sandwich Game" where amongst other things, celebrities get asked what colour sauce they’d have on their sausage sandwich (red, brown or none). Now I’ve been a committed brown man probably all my life, but in the spirit of the Something New adventure, I thought I’d break the habit of a lifetime and try some tomato ketchup on my sandwich.
Now having ketchup isn’t new for me - I’ll definitely have it on chips and with scrambled eggs when out the house - but to be honest it just wasn’t right on a sausage sandwich. It was a bit dull compared to the raw excitement that is brown sauce. It’ll be back to the good stuff next time.
