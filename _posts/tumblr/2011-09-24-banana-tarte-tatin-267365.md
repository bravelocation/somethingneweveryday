Banana Tarte Tatin (267/365)Usual Saturday drill - diet feast day so can eat what I want, so I go crazy and completely stuff my face. A little surprisingly this is still working, and having this 1 day a week off dieting really helps you through the other 6 days.
Anyway I decided to cook something new and made a Banana Tarte Tatin. It was actually quite simple, especially using ready prepared puff pastry bought from the supermarket which was another new thing for me. With a dollop of clotted cream it was really nice, not overly sweet, pretty fruity and well tasty.
