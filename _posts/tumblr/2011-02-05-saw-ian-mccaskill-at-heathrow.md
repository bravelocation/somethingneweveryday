I was wandering around Terminal 5 looking for something to do I hadn’t done before and was getting a bit desparate, but I then spotted what I’m almost certain was ex-TV weatherman Ian McCaskill wandering around.

Now I’ve always been very interested in the weather, and almost studied Meteorology for my first degree before I took one look at Reading and decided against it. Obviously Mr. McCaskill was your classic weatherman as a character, but IMHO nowhere near as good as the brilliant Daniel Corbett. To complete my fascinating review of current presenters, Hannah Bayman from Look North is always very interesting on Twitter and well worth following.

Anyway, a quick search shows no evidence that it wasn’t Ian McCaskill here at the airport, so I’m claiming it as something new so I can go home in a bit without having to worry about doing anything different when I get there. Hurrah!
