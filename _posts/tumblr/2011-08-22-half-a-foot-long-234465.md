Promised I wasn’t goint to keep doing diet things, but it is all new to me …
As you can see from my spreadsheet, week 1 went quite well and I lost 3lbs/2lbs of fat which is a good start and good incentive to keep going.
As I’ve been moaning about for quite a while our lunch opportunities in Victoria are much reduced, so our previous “last resort” of Subway is now much higher in the list of places to go. It’s not the healthiest (or the worst) place to go, but to show willing for the first time I only had a 6 inch veggie patty rather than the full foot long one. What willpower!
I think I’m starting to get used to eating less now, and am starting to notice the difference physically too. Hard part will obviously be keeping it going, but I’m hoping the making public what I’m doing will be incentive enough.
