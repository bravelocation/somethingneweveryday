After playing about with the new features in Mango on Monday, Microsoft announced registered developers can get the latest Windows Phone OS on their phones. To prepare for this I installed the newly named Windows Phone SDK on Wednesday.
The link shows all the new features available, and Iâ€™m really looking forward to trying out some of them shortly.
