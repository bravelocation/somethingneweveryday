Another day, another crap lunch in a new place near Victoria.

I didn’t expect much, but even so the rice and vegetable dish I had at [Wasabi](http://www.wasabi.uk.com/) on Victoria Street was still disappointing. Very little taste and even though you got quite a lot I couldn’t be arsed to finish it.

I may go back to try the sushi which didn’t look too bad, and I think that really the last new place left near the new office. Very disappointing :-(
