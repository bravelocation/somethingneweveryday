I was back at the flat, tired and out of inspiration, so I started flicking around the radio channels and happened upon Radio 3, which was playing Acts 2 and 3 of Die Walkure - which I now know (obviously via the power of t’Internet) is the 2nd part of Wagner’s Ring Cycle, and is definitely a new thing for me to listen to.
Now I know just about nothing about opera other than this is one of the most famous (and difficult?) operas, is very long, and somehow is related to the Nazis?
It was actually an interesting change to listen to something like this, and a few parts were a little familiar - mainly the Ride of the Valkyries part you all will have definitely heard before.
However I don’t think I’ve been completely converted to opera just yet, as I did end up watching the Brighton v Liverpool Carling Cup tie with the sound down on Sky Go at the same time.
