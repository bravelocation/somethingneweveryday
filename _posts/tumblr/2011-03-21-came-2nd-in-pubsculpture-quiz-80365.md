After a failed attempt on Valentines Day, I finally got to go to the pub quiz in Stoke Newington for the 1st time.

It was a really fun quiz, with the questions not too easy or too hard. We came 2nd after being pipped by just half a point, although we did get the bonus 3 points for the best foil sculpture which you can see in the picture.

My Close Encounters style “volcano” quickly got smoothed out and Josie and Mandy’s “Couple going to a ball” won the day despite strong competition from an excellent handbag and urinal made by another team.
