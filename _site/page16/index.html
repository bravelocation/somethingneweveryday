		</header>
      	<p>I thought it would be good to use Expedia - where I’d booked the hotel - to give a review of the <a href="http://www.expedia.co.uk/Copenhagen-Hotels-Hotel-Kong-Arthur.h519310.Hotel-Information?chkin=10%2F08%2F2011&amp;chkout=11%2F08%2F2011&amp;rm1=a1&amp;#reviews">Hotel Kong Arthur</a> where we’d stayed in Copenhagen a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>The hotel wasn’t that bad, but it wasn’t quite as good as you’d expect from the hotel details and reviews. I may have been more critical because it rained almost non-stop while we were there, but there were a few things that weren’t quite right. Ho hum.</p>

<p>As of Saturday afternoon the review hasn’t gone live yet, but they said it would take 5-7 days for it to appear which seems rather cautious.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Nothing particularly exciting to report, but we did go to <a href="http://www.cardinalplace.co.uk/Shops-Offers/Store-Plan/Browns-Bar-Brasserie">Browns Bar &amp; Brasserie</a> just across from the office for the first time. Full of lots of corporate types as you’d expect, but they did have a reasonably different menu of beers available (which I’m saving for another rainy day!)</p>

<p>Definitely think I’m a bit boozed out right now, so hopefully this will be the last pub-related entry for a while. </p>

		</header>
      	<p>Already a bit bored by the dull lunch options around Victoria, so we took a walk over to Pimlico to go to <a href="http://www.bing.com/local/details.aspx?lid=YN1098x233004030&amp;q=Pimlico%20Fresh%20Pimlico%2c%20London&amp;qt=yp&amp;tid=8e143f2e49ab4b748ad1d74a1bf667aa&amp;mkt=en-gb&amp;FORM=LLSV">Pimlico Fresh</a>, a nice little cafe about 10 minutes walk from the office.</p>

<p>Now I’d been there before when I used to that way last year, but with my quiche I had something new - pea salad with feta and a little spinach. It was quite nice and it was only later I realised what I’d really had was posh cheezy peas :-) </p>

      	<p>Back down in London again, but Frank and Josie hadn’t gone back to Valencia yet so we went out for a curry and a few drinks after work in Stoke Newington.</p>

<p>To eat, we went to <a href="http://www.bing.com/local/details.aspx?lid=YN1067x219882874&amp;qt=yp&amp;what=Karnaphuli&amp;where=Stoke+Newington%2c+London&amp;s_cid=ansPhBkYp02&amp;mkt=en-gb&amp;FORM=LARE">Karnaphuli</a> on Church Street. The food was good, offering a wide selection of dishes, although the service was pretty slow despite it being a Monday night with hardly anyone in there.</p>

      	<p>Sunday was the last day of my fortnight’s holiday, so we decided to go to the Metro Centre and watch the final Harry Potter film.</p>

<p>This was the first time I’d been to the 3D IMAX there, but another (slightly) more interesting new thing was that we went to the <a href="http://handmadeburger.co.uk/">Handmade Burger Company</a> afterwards. It’s an interesting place with a big choice of different burgers including 7 different veggie ones! There were pretty good and completed a good 2 weeks of not the most healthy eating. </p>

		</header>
      	<p>On the way home from Edinburgh we went to <a href="http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/">Rosslyn Chapel</a>, a very interesting place most famous for being where the climax of The Da Vinci Code takes place.</p>

<p>The chapel was much smaller than I expected, and the carvings inside were unbelievably detailed. Unfortunately I didn’t uncover any mysteries that could be spun into a blockbuster novel.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Friday was our last day in Edinburgh and surprisingly the sun came out, so we spent most of the day in the pub. We went to a couple of places I hadn’t been before, and the most interesting was <a href="http://www.kaysbar.co.uk/">Kays Bar</a> in the New Town.</p>

<p>It’s a tiny place tucked away on a back street, but was a great find and very friendly - highly recommended.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Thursday was a horrible day in Edinburgh with non-stop rain (which has been following me around), but luckily we were booked in to play skittles at <a href="http://www.sheepheid.co.uk/">The Sheep Heid Inn</a> in Duddingston.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting old place, and according to their website they’ve had skittles there since the 16th century. I played pretty terrible, but it was a excellent way to pass a few hours on a wet day.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>In Edinburgh for the final stage of my European tour with the Halesowen Jolly Boys and Girls, and as usual we spent most of the afternoon and evening in the pub.
Now most of the time was spent in places near where I used to live back in the day, so the only real new thing was trying some different beers I hadn’t had before. There were a few decent ones, but the one that stands out through the boozy memories was one called <a href="http://www.caledonian-brewery.co.uk/nectar/index.htm">Nectar Honey Ale</a> - mainly because it wasn’t very nice at all :-(</p>

<p>Despite the poor weather the drinking has continued apace this week, which hopefully explains the slight backlog in keeping the blog up-to-date!</p>

      	<p>In between vacation visits, but I went into Newcastle to meet Frank and Josie off the train, and while Josie was in <a href="http://www.opus-art.com/gallery/">Opus</a> talking shop we went for a drink in Crown Posada, a nice little real ale pub a bit further down Dean Street.</p>

<p>Not much more to say really, other than it was a decent place to spend a couple of hours.</p>
