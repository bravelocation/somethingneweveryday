		</header>
      	<p>We needed a pint and a sit down after a long day in meetings at work, so ended up wandering around a little between Victoria and St. James’s Park. We ended up in The Albert on Victoria Street, but on the way we walked past Prince Edward - the man not the pub.</p>

<p>No idea where he was headed, but he was very smartly dressed. We weren’t.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Found a great website on Monday called <a href="http://www.jeffblankenburg.com/2011/10/31/31-days-of-mango/">31 Days Of Mango</a>, which as you’d expect from the name has one tip each day for a month on developing for Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>There were lots of new things I learnt from the site (and continue to do so), and in particular it made me understand a bug I have in my Bedside Clock application in how it didn’t handle the change of power state very well. Turns out - which I should have realised - I need to make sure the UI updating code needs to be on a different thread.</p>

<p>If you’re doing any WP7 phone development, I definitely recommend taking a look at the site.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>I fancied some pasta for me tea, and on a quick trip down to Tesco in Hexham I found some that I hadn’t tried before called <a href="http://www.italianstay.com/italyinformation/pasta/trofie.htm">Trofie</a>.</p>

<p>According to the page I linked to above, it’s a Ligurian speciality, and despite looking slightly weird (a bit like pasta twiglets) it tasted really nice with an Arriabiata sauce. Will definitely try again as I have half a bag left :-)</p>

      	<p>I hadn’t done any baking for a while, and I had a fancy for some jam tarts so I thought I’d have a go at baking some. </p>

<p>I didn’t realise how easy it was going to be, otherwise I would have made them before. I just got some ready made shortcrust pastry, cut out the pieces, filled with jam then put in the oven.</p>

<p>Lovely with some clotted cream.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>I’ve always loved the name of “pigs in a blanket” for a type of food. In the UK that means sausages wrapped in bacon, but it turns out there are lots of other meanings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigs_in_a_blanket">around the world</a>. Who knew?</p>

<p>Obviously being a vegetarian has meant I can’t really have this delicacy, but I decided to make an innovative alternative version by wrapping some veggie sausages in some “false meat” ham - and them in a sandwich.</p>

<p>Quite nice without being particularly interesting, but there being no such thing as decent veggie bacon about the best I can do unfortunately.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Earlier posts have hinted about this already, but this week my usual Thursday train trip back home from London was in the First Class carriage for the first time.</p>

<p>Although I wasn’t expecting much it was actually great. As soon as I got on I was offered tea or coffee, and then was continually offered drinks for the whole journey - I just had a couple of bottles of water and then succumbed to a nice glass of red wine. There was also dinner on offer, and as I’m still dieting I decided against, but the vegetarian option of goat’s cheese tart sounded OK too.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t pay the extra money for travelling first class - it didn’t get me home any quicker - but as part of the frequent traveller program from East Coast I’ll definitely be doing it again.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>I was looking for something for me tea, so rather absentmindedly I went up to Tescos on Tottenham High Street, forgetting how crappy it is. It had been a long day, and by the time I left I decided to be very lazy and get the bus down the Seven Sisters Road back to the flat rather than the 15 minutes walk - first time I’ve done that.</p>

<p>With my dodgy knees I do try to walk the 10-15 minutes at each end of my journey every day as it does help a lot (not if I do much more) but it’s been a very busy couple of weeks away from home - which I’ll use as an excuse for my lazyness.</p>

<p>It’s the final weighing of my 14 week diet on Saturday, so we’ll see how a week in the US and a hectic work schedule has affected it.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Thanks to colleagues Ward (who brought them from the US) and Paul (who convinced me to try them) I ate a sea salt chocolate from Trader Joes yesterday.</p>

<p>They were exactly what it sounds like they are - fancy chocolates with salt on top. A very strange taste, but actually quite nice - although the salt stopped you wanting another one.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>I haven’t done much mobile phone development recently, but I’ve been looking at the reviews for my <a href="http://www.bravelocation.com/bedsideclock">Bedside Clock</a> application, and decided to make some improvements.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was add a separate settings screen, but I didn’t know how you’re supposed to switch between forms. So yesterday I learnt something new, and found out about the built-in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.navigation.navigationservice.aspx">Navigation service</a>, which treats XAML pages as URLs and then you can switch between them.</p>

<p>Simple enough, and meant I could make decent progress on Bedside Clock v3.</p>

		</header>
      	<p>Back in the UK, and when entering via Heathrow Terminal 5 I used the ePassport line for the first time.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it before, but usually I’m transferring to an internal flight up to Newcastle in a different part of immigration. All I had to do was first put in my picture page into the scanner,wait while it did some facial recognition for a few seconds and then I was back in the country. No quicker than the cursory glance the passport official usually gives you, but the line was definitely shorter.</p>

<p>Obviously you need an ePassport, but mine was issues in 2006 so I assume they are not that rare.</p>
